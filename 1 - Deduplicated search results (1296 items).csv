2001,Facilitating System-of-Systems Evolution with Architecture Support,"The evolution of system-of-systems (SOS) is an emerging challenge and requires systematic architecture capabilities and support. This paper discusses the features of SOS evolution and introduces a key concept, Architecture Evolution Environment, to facilitate the evolution. We argue that an architecture solution for specific evolution requirements can be reached only when its evolution environment is addressed.",10.1145/602461.602489,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/602461.602489,acm; googlescholar; scopus
2005,Systems of Systems and Coordinated Atomic Actions,"System of systems (SoS) is an emerging field in the design and development of complex systems that are built from large scale component systems. A SoS has the following attributes: operational and managerial independence of components, a geographic extent that limits control mechanisms to information exchange, an evolutionary nature, and emergent behavior. The subsystems that comprise the SoS often are built by different organizations with conflicting goals, designed under different assumptions and built to different quality standards. These factors impact fault detection, fault isolation, and fault tolerance and can result in systems that cannot easily be debugged, integrated, or maintained. When fault detection and fault tolerance are deficient, the system may behave in a fragile or brittle manner, randomly and repeatedly crashing. Crashes prevent automated diagnosis algorithms from being executed and can prevent manual root cause analysis by erasing system state. Fragility during system integration can prevent achieving schedule milestones and deadlines. Deficient fault detection and fault isolation also impacts end users and system maintainers. (Think <insert name="""" of="""" infamous="""" project="""" here="""">).From the system architect's point of view, designing a system that can detect all possible fault conditions across all components can be an extremely difficult, if not impossible challenge. Can any system be trusted to diagnose or repair itself when it has been corrupted by faults? How do you prevent local faults from growing into global failures? The end users may have unreasonable expectations about how the system should behave when components within the SoS behave abnormally or fail. They may expect better behavior than the typical PC. The system maintainers may expect a coherent systems view of failures to isolate faulted components and to provide an orderly and safe shutdown or recovery.(Think power grid blackouts, Telecomm failures, etc.)The most beneficial way to achieve fault tolerance is to design in fault detection and fault reporting such that defined boundaries such as subsystems serve as natural firewalls for fault containment. Although partitioning the system into subsystems for fault containment is well known and practiced, the end result as experienced at the time of system integration is rarely a success. COTS middleware, intended to aid distributed design often becomes in effect a step backwards by providing fertile ground for faults and failures that breach fault containment boundaries. (Think <insert name="""" of="""" os="""" or="""" middleware="""" vendor="""" here="""">)What can be done to improve this situation? This paper addresses the system architectural partitioning concept of the Coordinated Atomic Actions (CAA). CAA promotes a different manner of organizing software architecture that improves fault containment across potentially faulty components. CAA was first invented by members of Brian Randell's research group at the University of Newcastle at Tyne in the mid 1990's. CAA promotes the concept of the ""transaction"" which has been traditionally identified with database applications. When you access your bank account via ATM, you are exercising database transactions within your bank's financial SoS. CAA applies transactions to cooperating concurrent distributed processes, which are the basis for most large complex computing systems.",10.1145/1039174.1039196,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1039174.1039196,acm; googlescholar
2005,A Government Perspective on Digital Data Embedding: Taking a Systems Approach,"This talk will focus on the maturity of Digital Data Embedding technologies - watermarking, steganography, steganalysis, and digital data forensics. As individual methods and small systems, these algorithms have shown great potential for application to many commercial and military needs in the areas of information assurance, communication and protection. However, one largely ignored aspect of data embedding development has been the systems perspective - how these technologies will contribute and interact with other critical technologies in the development of large scale system solutions. As the military moves toward network-centric, fully integrated systems it is expected that digital data embedding technologies will play crucial roles. Data embedding provides a range of enabling technologies which can help achieve data-centric, as opposed to application-centric, information assurance.The current state of the art in digital data embedding techniques and how they have matured in recent years will be addressed. The technology will be traced through the development of standalone algorithms to the small, integrated systems that are appearing today. Applications involving digital data embedding technologies integrated with other technologies, such as biometrics and cryptography, provide the first glimpses into the systems of the future. A projection as to how these integrated systems will evolve into the net-centric, system-of-systems will be presented. This challenge will require maintaining a strong connection from research through development and use, to ensure future architectures and the needs of users are addressed. While many open questions remain, the discussion will provide perspective and illustrate some challenges to be investigated as the field moves forward.",10.1145/1073170.1073172,,acm; scopus
2008,CPS-IP: Cyber Physical Systems Interconnection Protocol,"As sensing, wireless communication, and embedded computing technologies evolve, more and more special-purpose cyber physical systems are emerging in our daily lives, such as mobile tracking and health care system, emplaced environmental monitoring systems, and building maintenance control systems. In these systems, heterogeneity is a fundamental research issue. To enable standard communication between these systems, we propose a new communication construct: CPS-IP and a framework combined with it. The goal is to facilitate the creation of systems of systems where there is an integration of myriads of physical data sources, actuators, and computing elements. Different from the Internet Protocol which is designed for a large scale, general-purpose systems, CPS-IP is designed for special- purpose CPS systems built on critical infrastructure which requires global regulation and performance assurance for cyber physical interaction. The novelty of our design is that we address heterogeneity of CPS systems at three different levels: function interoperability, policy regulation, and performance assurance.",10.1145/1366283.1366305,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1366283.1366305,acm; googlescholar
2008,Process Evolution to Support System of Systems Engineering,"One of the current research areas at the University of Southern California (USC) Center for Systems and Software Engineering (CSSE) is the development of large scale, software intensive systems of systems (SoS). These SoS are a type of Ultra-Large-Scale Software-Intensive System (ULSSIS) that have become increasingly prevalent in both government and commercial sectors. Research activities have focused on cost estimation and risk assessment associated with the development and evolution of these systems. As part of this research, USC CSSE has teamed with others to learn how SoS engineering processes are evolving to support the development of these systems. This paper highlights the findings of these research activities.",10.1145/1370700.1370704,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1370700.1370704,acm; scopus; googlescholar
2008,System of Systems Complexity: Modeling and Simulation Issues,"Capability-based acquisition changes the general approach to systems engineering. Instead of buying threat-based, service-specific systems, a mobile target-weapon pairing system, for example, and then identifying how to integrate that system with other similar threat-based systems, we now identify the warfighting capabilities we want to achieve. Then we start with a 'blank sheet of paper' to develop the systems architecture and technical standards necessary to allow seamless interaction using shared data and applications. [1] Capability-based acquisition focuses on the development of alternative system of systems (SoS) architectures that link (i.e., network) diverse interoperable systems to optimize overarching capability effectiveness while minimizing development costs.It is up to the systems architect and engineer to find the best solution by examining inter-relationships between various configurations of warfighters, platforms, sensors, weapons, command and control, communications, while considering external factors that potentially impact full capability effectiveness and sustainment, such as operational doctrine, joint operations, government and societal organizations, terrorism, and public opinion. The emergence of asymmetric warfare, military-operations-other-than-war, effects-based and network-centric operations, national crisis response (and other homeland security missions), and other large scale problems where many diverse systems (often human individual and organizational decision-making systems) interact in complex ways, serves to complicate the process of developing an effectively interoperable system.It is a complex undertaking to integrate a complex system of systems. Accordingly, the concept of system of systems has become increasingly important to systems engineering. One needs to understand the nature of the complexity of system of systems to gain insight into the design of robust, interoperable systems that integrate seamlessly into a system of systems environment.Complexity - regardless of whether a system is hardware, software, or people - is generally a function of the number of entities (nodes) in the system, the number of relations (interfaces, interactions, networks), and time dependence (of interactions). Added complexity emerges when systems are capable of adapting their behavior to meet changing environmental conditions (complex adaptive systems) and when systems are capable of learning or evolving new behaviors. This paper explores a set of metrics that define the complexity of a system of systems simulation and presents preliminary work underway to apply these ideas for improving the quality and efficiency of the systems engineering process.",,,acm; scopus
2008,USAF Coalition Distributed Mission Operations (DMO): Achieving Multinational Full Mission Training in Integrated LVC Environments,"Contemporary military leaders face numerous obstacles to establishing secure and cost-effective systems and processes to train and mission rehearse coalition operations in operationally realistic conditions. This paper examines the U. S. Air Force Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) program and the critical elements and lessons learned through its ongoing efforts to establish routine coalition training capabilities using high-fidelity mission simulators in an integrated Live/Virtual/Constructive (LVC) simulation-based training architecture.The DMO vision remains to provide warfighters routine in-garrison access to multiple, simultaneous, and large/small training or mission rehearsal events within a true joint force environment. Over the past several years, the Air Force has been working with a variety of international partners, joint and combatant commands, research laboratories, and technical communications and security experts to begin the careful expansion of DMO training to establish baseline coalition training capabilities within the national and international technical security environment that such systems must operate. This baseline requires the ability for technically non-standard high-fidelity virtual full mission simulators to inter-operate within operationally realistic and computer generated environments, at appropriate levels of national and multi-national security classification and releasability using as-yet undeveloped and unapproved cross-domain solutions, procedures and standards. The implementation of the USAF coalition DMO vision both complements and complicates corresponding efforts to expand the larger Joint National Training Capabilities (JNTC) systems and networks to accommodate persistent coalition distributed LVC training capabilities and holds valuable lessons for the NATO's Project SNOW LEOPARD.This paper proposes three key elements, each with technical, policy, and contractual implications that are necessary to achieve the legal, security, and funding authority to operate through which the successful establishment of coalition training operations may be achieved. It will outline many of these efforts and examine many of the policy and technical wickets that must be run to make such complex international systems-of-systems work. It will also discuss impacts to exercise planning and scenario generation that often complicate the achievement of robust training objectives within coalition training events. Finally, this paper highlights the potential need for new training processes required by the identification and evolution of coalition DMO/JNTC technical capabilities and their potential impacts on simulator/simulation design, training system architectures, and professional control force functions.",,,acm; scopus
2009,Towards Self-Adaptive Software-Intensive Systems,"With the rapid growth of web services and socio-technical ecosystems, the management complexity of these modern, decentralized, distributed computing systems presents significant challenges for businesses and often exceeds the capabilities of human operators. The simultaneous explosion of information and integration of technology and the continuous evolution from software intensive systems to systems of systems to ULS systems requires new and innovative approaches for evolving, running, and managing software systems. A consequence of this continuous evolution is that software systems must become more versatile, flexible, resilient, dependable, robust, continuously available, energy-efficient, recoverable, customizable, self-healing, configurable, or self-optimizing by adapting to changing contexts and environments. One of the most promising approaches to achieving such properties is to equip software systems with self-adaptation and self-management mechanisms. Autonomic computing constitutes an effective set of technologies, models, architecture patterns, standards, and processes to cope with and reign in the management complexity of dynamic computing systems using feedback control, adaptation, and self-management. At the core of such systems are control loops which sense their environment, model their behavior in that environment, and take action to change the environment or their own behavior. Computer science researchers often approach the design of such highly dynamic systems from a software architecture perspective whereas engineering researchers start with a feedback control perspective.",10.1145/1595808.1595811,,acm; webofscience
2009,Data-Flow Integration Testing Adapted to Runtime Evolution in Component-Based Systems,"Systems of Systems are large-scale information centric component-based systems. Because they can be more easily expressed as an information flow, they are built following the data-flow paradigm. These systems present high availability requirements that make their runtime evolution necessary. This means that integration and system testing will have to be performed at runtime as well. Already existing techniques for runtime integration and testing are usually focused on component-based systems which follow the client-server paradigm, and are not well suited for data-flow systems. In this paper we present virtual components, a way of defining units of data-flow behaviour that greatly simplifies the definition and maintenance of integration tests when the system evolves at runtime. We present and discuss an example of how to use virtual components for thispurpose.",10.1145/1596495.1596499,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1596495.1596499,acm; scopus; googlescholar; webofscience

We are assessing integrated systems and software engineering at the enterprise level, where rapid response software development projects incrementally evolve capabilities of existing systems and/or systems of systems. A kanban-based scheduling system was defined and implemented with connected discrete, continuous and agent-based models. We are simulating the process performance vs. traditional methods of sharing systems engineering services across projects, and whether the overall value of the systems of systems over time is increased.",10.1109/ICSSP.2012.6225976,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6225976/,acm; googlescholar; ieeeexplore; scopus
2012,Improving Systems Engineering Effectiveness in Rapid Response Development Environments,"Systems engineering is often ineffective in development environments where large, complex, brownfield systems of systems are evolved through parallel development of new capabilities in response to external, time-sensitive requirements. This paper defines a conceptual framework to improve that effectiveness and better integrate the systems engineering and software engineering processes. The framework is based on a services approach to systems engineering and the use of kanban techniques to schedule scarce enterprise systems engineering resources across multiple related systems and software development projects. The framework also addresses the differing value of work items to multiple stakeholders in the scheduling and coordination processes. Models and simulations are being used to capture, refine and validate the framework prior to in vivo experimentation.",,,acm
2012,Architecting Ultra-Large-Scale Green Information Systems,"As environmental sustainability issues have come to the societal and governmental forefront, a new breed of Green Information Systems (IS)---Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) Green IS---is emerging. A ULS Green IS is an open socio-technical ecosystem that differs from traditional IS in scale, complexity and urgency. Design issues found in ULS systems, System of Systems, Edge-dominant, Metropolis systems and Green IS converge and multiply in the ULS Green IS context. This paper presents a design framework and an architecture analysis method, ECO-ARCH, to address the design of such systems. Through an action research study on architecting for Demand Response systems in the Smart Grid, this article illuminates the system characteristics of ULS Green IS and endorses a fundamental shift in design thinking for its design -- from ""bounded rationality"" for problem solving to ""expandable rationality"" for design for the unknown and for innovation. ECO-ARCH advances existing software architecture analysis methods by complimenting expandable rationality design thinking with proven engineering techniques in a dual-level macroscopic-microscopic analysis. This tackles the unique architecting problems of ULS Green IS where many stakeholders are unknown and design goals are not provided, where no architecture pre-exists, where system behavior is non-deterministic and continuously evolving, and where co-creation with consumers and prosumers is essential to achieving triple bottom line goals.",10.1109/GREENS.2012.6224259,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus
2013,Evolving Systems of Systems: Industrial Challenges and Research Perspectives,"An increasing number of software systems today are systems of systems (SoS) comprising decentralized and heterogeneous systems with operational and managerial independence. The evolution of SoS is the rule and not the exception in practice due to frequently changing requirements, technologies, and markets. However, providing adequate support for the evolution of SoS is rather challenging as their behavior often emerges at runtime and is difficult to predict. Hence, SoS must be monitored during simulation and operation to ensure compliance with its requirements. In this position paper, we present challenges for SoS evolution from the domain of industrial automation. We discuss existing approaches supporting SoS evolution and derive research issues. We outline requirements for SoS evolution support and present key capabilities of a flexible monitoring and evolution infrastructure. We conclude with a discussion of research perspectives.",10.1145/2489850.2489851,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2489850.2489851,acm; googlescholar; scopus
2013,On Self-Adaptation in Systems-of-Systems,"Adaptivity and systems-of-systems (SoS) have always had a close relationship, as it is one of their defining features. Moreover, there is a clear similarity between the requirements of a SoS and those of many adaptive systems, such as autonomic and self-adaptive systems. In recent years, this kind of adaptive systems has been carefully studied; however, they often operate at a very different scale, being smaller than a typical SoS. The common nexus between both perspectives seem to be situated at the architectural level: the same adaptive techniques are recursively applied in different strata in a hierarchical composite. Therefore, the principles embodied in adaptive architectures seem to provide a good basis for the definition and description of SoS. This paper relates those principles to the corresponding structures in software evolution, and suggests to coordinate both through a pace layering strategy.",10.1145/2489850.2489856,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2489850.2489856,acm; scopus; googlescholar
2013,The State of the Art and Future Perspectives in Systems of Systems Software Architectures,"Currently, software systems have become increasingly large and complex, often resulted by the integration of several operationally independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems: the Systems of Systems (SoS). In another perspective, software architectures play a major role in determining system quality, since they form the backbone of any successful software-intensive system. Attention given to the software architectures of SoS is also certainly fundamental to the success of such systems. However, it is observed that there is a lack of works that present a wide and, at the same time, a detailed panorama about how SoS architectures have been treated. In this scenario, the main contribution of this paper is to present the state of the art on software architectures of SoS, mainly regarding their development, representation, evaluation, and evolution. This work also contributes with future research topics on SoS architectures that should be still investigated. Besides that, we intend this paper opens new perspectives of research in the software architecture area, intending to contribute to the success of SoS.",10.1145/2489850.2489853,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2489850.2489853,acm; scopus; googlescholar

The challenging topics discussed include: (i) the representation of the SoS elements; (ii) the interactions between the constituent elements; (iii) the dynamic support to enable the evolutionary nature of SoS; (iv) the need of handling quality attributes.",10.1145/2489850.2489857,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2489850.2489857,acm; scopus; googlescholar

The approach of software system development is called Federated Embedded Systems (FES) and their revolved ecosystem of players is presented, aiming to ensure quality in engineering SoS. Ecosystems for Federated Embedded Systems (EcoFES) comprise a new area of research that scales component-based software development for embedded software into new dimensions. The proposed ecosystem dimension introduces an open, flexible and adaptable SoS architecture for improving the process of FES development. In the paper, we identify some architectural challenges and discuss the implications of scaling from a closed ecosystem to an open one, providing open collaboration and innovation in the context of FES.",10.1145/2489850.2489854,,acm
2013,5th Annual Workshop on Interoperability and Smart Interactions in Healthcare (ISIH),"In May 2013 the Health Council of Canada released its third report on the state of healthcare renewal in Canada. Although the report identified that significant progress had been made in several areas since the previous reports in 2008 and 2011, this year's report still described the need for work to ensure our healthcare system evolves and will be sustainable for the years to come.One particular challenge is the need to integrate services over an expanding continuum of providers, services and illnesses. Healthcare delivery is becoming increasingly complex as it shifts from care provided by a single provider and setting to collaborative care provided by multiple providers across multiple settings. For example, patients with chronic illness frequently move between inpatient and outpatient settings and require collaboration by physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals that act as an integrated network across hospital and community settings.Another highlighted challenge was the need for performance measurement of healthcare delivery by establishing meaningful targets and measurable goals to enable healthcare delivery to be driven by good management practices.In light of the above challenges to healthcare delivery it can be argued that the fundamental challenge our healthcare system faces is one of connectivity and assurance. Successful healthcare interoperability will be dependent upon our ability to connect and assure people, processes, data, policies and procedures, as well as the need to connect outcomes to system objectives through performance management. Mobile healthcare has the potential to dramatically extend the reach and impact of interoperability and smart interactions on healthcare outcomes.In our previous four workshops on Interoperability and Smart Interactions in Healthcare (ISIH) we emphasized that the fundamental challenges facing interoperability are not technical but rather process, people and evaluation issues. It is important that we do not define interoperability as the ends but rather as a means for assuring core health system objectives such as efficient, effective, and safe delivery of patient centered healthcare. Subsequently we should not evaluate interoperability efforts solely by our ability to connect disparate computer systems but rather by our abilities to achieve health system objectives.However to effectively evaluate healthcare delivery we need to develop and implement business analytic solutions to enable timely evaluation of healthcare delivery. As we move towards digital solutions such as electronic health records to enhance healthcare delivery our goal should not be to simply automate existing healthcare processes such as group decision making or communication. Rather our goal should be to leverage smart interactions and technologies to enable processes to go beyond how healthcare delivery is currently provided.Healthcare is a complex, dynamic and exception laden ecosystem. Smart interactions and interoperable technologies provide us the tools to support the dynamic nature of healthcare delivery to enable us to assure quality of care. For example, the management of diabetes requires medical registries to track patients over time and to communicate guidelines for ongoing clinical management. In that context, human factors research, cloud computing, consumer health services, and the ongoing evaluation and adoption of standards, technology and processes are all relevant.Meaningful interoperability can also enable performance management solutions to ensure we provide timely, efficient patient centered care delivery. However, the development of technologies to support meaningful interoperability faces significant challenges such as obtaining consistent, timely, quality data in a secure manner to facilitate performance-managed driven healthcare delivery. We also caution that an uncoordinated approach to the design and implementation of smart interactions and other information technology will only create barriers to accessibility and integration by burdening healthcare providers with administrative and information overload that falls short of delivering real benefits. To facilitate meaningful interoperability we need to first understand the underlying complexity of healthcare interoperability by developing models and frameworks that enable us to effectively leverage Mobile Health, consumer health apps, and other Smart technologies to support healthcare delivery.This year's workshop was presented and coordinated by a select group of health informatics and software engineering researchers, and practitioners from across Canada and will build upon our previous four workshops with the theme of going beyond individual applications towards a ""systems of systems"" perspective that considers technology as well as human factors and organizational structures. Our workshop will emphasize the need to develop healthcare approaches to assure safety, interoperability and quality of care at the level of the integrated socio-technical health care ecosystem.The previous four ISIH workshops were well attended by a mix of health care administrators, practitioners, representatives from standards body's initiatives, as well as academic researchers and industry partners. This year workshop focused on developing an agenda for researching meaningful ways to assure safety and interoperability in socio-technical health ecosystems and included case studies and anecdotes to illustrate the issues and potential solutions as a starting point for brainstorming and research initiatives that will lead to a systematic approach to the issues.The following questions will be posed:How can safety, effectiveness and interoperability goals be assured in an evolving socio-technical healthcare ecosystem?What regulatory controls and measures are effective in assuring critical eco-systems, specifically the healthcare ecosystem?What are the current systemic barriers that need to be overcome to achieve assured interoperability and safety?The workshop opened with short presentations from the panel members who provided background and outlined their basic position but also recounted actual experiences or academic results related to the questions. The second half was devoted to an interactive discussion in which the presenters debated different aspects and issues in response to questions from the audience. The closing part was reserved for general brainstorming guided by the moderators into a discussion of potential next steps and an action plan for collaboration and further exchanges of ideas beyond the end of the workshop.The panel presentations discussed the promises, challenges and risks of an information technology focused healthcare ecosystem and how we can leverage human factors research, cloud computing, health consumer informatics, safety engineering and the ongoing evaluation and adoption of standards, technology and processes to assure smarter interactions between health care providers and health care consumers (the patients). The workshop concluded with a summation of interoperability and assurance issues in health care and a chance to form collaborative partnerships with the workshop participants. In particular, we hope that one of the outcomes of this workshop will be to create a call for papers for a special journal issue on interoperability, assurance and smart interactions in socio-technical healthcare ecosystems.",,,acm

Independently developed plug-ins can be added and removed as desired to dramatically change the system. This design allows input plug-ins (model, experimental), execution plug-ins (simulator), and output plug-ins to be developed separately and pieced together to form a unique system while allowing development to be compartmentalized. With the OSM framework, an evolutionary system of systems can be intelligently created by a community. Each community member only needs to fully understand the pieces they personally develop.

Due to their heterogeneity and complexity VLSS are difficult to understand and analyze, which results in various challenges for development and evolution. Existing software engineering processes, methods, and tools do not sufficiently address the characteristics of VLSS. Also, there are only a few empirical studies on software engineering for VLSS. We report on results of an exploratory case study involving engineers and technical project managers of an industrial automation VLSS for metallurgical plants. The paper provides empirical evidence on how VLSS are tested, commissioned, and operated in practice. The paper discusses practical challenges and reports industrial requirements regarding process and tool support. In particular, software processes and tools need to provide general guidance at the VLSS level as well as specific methods and tools for systems that are part of the VLSS. Processes and tools need to support multi-disciplinary engineering across system boundaries. Furthermore, managing variability and evolution is success-critical in VLSS verification and validation.",10.1145/2591062.2591179,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2591062.2591179,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,When Ecosystems Collide: Making Systems of Systems Work,"The objective of this research is to identify issues that arise when software systems from different ecosystems are composed into a system of systems. Whether it is an explicit, managed ecosystem or the implicit ecosystem of collaborators, competitors, and users that surrounds any organization, the community of organizations has momentum in a particular direction. When a system of systems is composed using systems from each of several ecosystems the differences in communities can prevent satisfactory integration. We examine the case of a portion of the infrastructure needed to support automated driving. We use Maier's criteria that identify challenges for systems of systems as starting points for investigations into differences among ecosystems. We found points of commonality that tie together the ecosystems include use of common standards, membership by large organizations in multiple ecosystems, and influences of the outside business environment. We also found points of variation including whether the systems have compatible real-time expectations, terms of licenses, frequency of new releases, and architectural assumptions. Developers of a system of systems benefit from being aware of the similarities and differences among the ecosystems from which their systems originate because both the similarities and differences help developers anticipate the evolutionary trajectories of the individual systems.",10.1145/2642803.2642832,,acm; scopus
2015,Variability Management for a Runtime Monitoring Infrastructure,"Many software systems today are systems of systems (SoS), which are difficult to analyze due to their size, complexity, heterogeneity, and variability. For instance, unexpected behavior of SoS is often caused by the complex interactions between the involved systems and their environment at runtime. Monitoring infrastructures (MIs) provide support for engineers and support staff analyzing the behavior of SoS during development and operation. Variability plays an important role in MIs, however, while some approaches exist, managing variability of MIs remains challenging. In this paper, we describe how we applied a variability management approach to support the reconfiguration of a SoS monitoring infrastructure (MI) at runtime. Our approach provides configuration support for setting up the MI to reflect system variability. It also supports runtime reconfiguration of the MI to reflect the different monitoring tasks of users and to support evolution. We motivate our work using the case of monitoring a real-world SoS from the domain of industrial automation and discuss variability-related challenges in four monitoring scenarios. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to these scenarios. We also demonstrate that our approach reduces manual reconfiguration effort and helps to reduce the overhead of the MI.",10.1145/2701319.2701330,,acm; scopus

Their growing use leads to an extensive amount of available data to be processed and causes smart grids to evolve to large-scale systems of systems. Guaranteeing appropriate scalability and performance characteristics is a tremendous challenge. In this paper, we focus on the provisioning of sufficient computing capacity to efficiently analyze the produced data in such a distributed system. For this purpose, we show the use of performance models to plan and simulate this distributed computation in smart grid systems. It demonstrates how different system architectures can be evaluated and required capacities can be estimated to cope with the occurring data volume.

2015,Towards Model Driven Architecture and Analysis of System of Systems Access Control,"Nowadays there is growing awareness of the importance of Systems of Systems (SoS) which are large-scale systems composed of complex systems. SoS possess specific properties when compared with monolithic complex systems, in particular: operational independence, managerial independence, evolutionary development, emergent behavior and geographic distribution. One of the current main challenges is the impact of these properties on SoS security modeling and analysis. In this research proposal, we introduce a new method incorporating a process, a language and a software architectural tool to model, analyze and predict security architectural alternatives of SoS.

2015,Characterizing Architecture Description Languages for Software-Intensive Systems-of-Systems,"Systems-of-Systems (SoS) result from associating independent, complex systems for fulfilling given missions. In particular, SoS require software architectures that can cope with their dynamic, critical nature. Selecting adequate Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) for representing such architectures contributes for a better communication, analysis, and evolution of these systems. Nonetheless, a consensus on which characteristics are important for describing SoS is not available yet. In this context, the main contribution of this study is the identification of the main features to be provided by ADLs for describing SoS software architectures. In the light of these features, we assessed some existing ADLs that have been used for this task and we noticed that they still miss some of the identified features. With this set of features, we intend to contribute to the SoS field with directions for making ADLs more suitable for the description of SoS software architectures.",10.1109/SESoS.2015.10,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7179218/,acm; googlescholar; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2015,On the Architecture-Driven Development of Software-Intensive Systems-of-Systems,"Nowadays, complex software-intensive systems have resulted from the integration of heterogeneous independent systems, thus leading to a new class of systems called Systems-of-Systems (SoS). As in any system, SoS architectures have been regarded as an important element for determining their success. However, the state of the art reveals shortcomings that contribute to compromise the quality of these systems, as their inherent characteristics (such as emergent behavior and evolutionary development) are often not properly addressed. In this context, this PhD research aims at investigating how SoS software architectures can be used to model and evolve these systems. As main contribution, an architecture-centric approach for developing software-intensive SoS with focus on the formal specification and dynamic reconfiguration of their architectures is proposed. Such an approach mainly intends to contribute to fill some of the relevant existing gaps regarding the development of software-intensive SoS driven by their software architectures.",10.1109/ICSE.2015.287,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

So referred as Systems-of-Systems (SoS), this new class of systems has emerged in special in critical application domains. In another perspective, reference architecture is a special type of software architecture that has provided a considerable support to the development, evolution, and also standardization of systems of given application domains. Considering their usefulness, reference architectures are even more important to SoS than they have been today, by making it possible to mainly promote interoperability among constituent systems of SoS. Adequate interoperability in SoS has been still a great challenge to the community. In this scenario, this foreword arises challenges in this new research topic of reference architectures for SoS.

2015,A System-of-Systems Approach for Integrated Energy Systems Modeling and Simulation,"Energy systems integration combines energy carriers, including electricity, with infrastructures, to maximize efficiency and minimize waste. In order to study systems at a variety of physical scales---from individual buildings to distribution systems---interconnected through these energy infrastructures, NREL is developing an Integrated Energy System Model (IESM), with an initial focus on the electricity system. Today's electricity grid is the most complex system ever built---and the future grid is likely to be even more complex because it will incorporate distributed energy resources (DERs) such as wind, solar, and various other sources of generation and energy storage. The complexity is further augmented by the possible evolution to new retail market structures that would provide incentives to owners of DERs to support the grid. The IESM can be used to understand and test the impact of new retail market structures and technologies such as DERs, demand-response equipment, and energy management systems on the system's ability to provide reliable electricity to all customers. The IESM is composed of a power flow simulator (GridLAB-D), building and appliance models including home energy management system implemented using either GAMS or Pyomo, a market layer, and is able to include hardware-in-the-loop simulation (testing appliances such as air conditioners, dishwashers, etc.). The IESM is a system-of-systems (SoS) simulator wherein the constituent systems are brought together in a virtual testbed. We will describe an SoS approach for developing a distributed simulation environment. We will elaborate on the methodology and the control mechanisms used in the co-simulation illustrated by a case study.",,,acm; scopus

The emergent behavior in SoS manifests in-situ and lack computational and systems engineering approaches to prevent the engineering of emergent behaviors in SoS modeling and simulation (M&amp;S).

2015,"Systems of Systems Engineering: Basic Concepts, Model-Based Techniques, and Research Directions","The term “System of Systems” (SoS) has been used since the 1950s to describe systems that are composed of independent constituent systems, which act jointly towards a common goal through the synergism between them. Examples of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production, and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence, heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field. A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural description, simulation, verification, and testing. Finally, the identified dimensions of SoS characteristics are used to identify research challenges and future research areas of model-based SoS engineering.",10.1145/2794381,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2794381,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Modeling of Information Systems as Systems of Systems through DSM,"Information systems may be composed of dozens of software applications managed by different teams knowing only part of the whole system. During the evolution, the structure of information systems tends to become more and more complex. This opens the problem of understanding and managing the Information System-level architecture where a software component is a whole software application.We present the preliminary results of a project aiming at modeling information systems as Systems of Systems via Design Structure Matrices (DSM).The information system is modeled as a matrix describing components (software applications) and connectors (relations between applications). The model, implemented with the Cambridge Advanced Modeler tool, allows us loading the matrix and visualize it as a graph of nodes and oriented arcs. Different classes of users may be interested in different views of the model. A view originates specific attributes of components and connectors. The tool allows us querying the model highlighting nodes and arcs of interest for a specific view.The case studies -- composed of about a hundred software applications -- consist of the information systems of a retail company and of an hospital.",10.1145/2897829.2897832,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2016,Event Capture and Compare for Runtime Monitoring of Systems of Systems,"Today's complex software systems are highly variable systems of systems (SoS) that evolve continuously to meet new customer requirements or to address technological changes. Despite thorough testing of the different parts of an SoS, the full behavior often emerges during operation only. The systems and their interactions thus need to be continuously monitored and checked during operation to determine compliance with their requirements. In particular, after changes to one system, it is necessary to check whether the overall SoS still behaves correctly and as intended. Based on an existing monitoring framework we are developing support for capturing and comparing event traces in SoS. Our approach facilitates, and partly automates, identifying differences in event traces, which often indicate undesirable behavior introduced during evolution. In this position paper we motivate capture-and-compare support in SoS using an industrial example and present early research results including a prototype.",10.1145/2897045.2897046,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Implementations of outerfaces are defined separately. Our underlying framework, TAIGA, lets the user code directly to the outerface and automatically finds, validates and binds an appropriate implementation. The framework handles component evolution and failure by detected changes and dynamically revalidating and rebinding possibly new implementations to existing outerfaces while maintaining the running system.

The relevance and timeliness of this topic reflects the current and future trends toward more software-intensive systems, with greater complexity, autonomy, speed of change, and need for interoperability within systems of systems, given the frequent system shortfalls and overruns that occur when their SQ balance is not achieved. It discusses the weaknesses of current SQ standards and guidance, and summarizes research toward strengthening current SQ definitions and relationships. This includes a set of initial SQ ontology elements and relationships, examples of their application to some key SQs, an identification of further research and development needed to make the ontology fully useful and evolvable, and the nature of an international collaborative effort to help improve current practices via a Qualipedia for accessing the evolving body of knowledge for improving SQ engineering.",10.1145/2889160.2891049,,acm; scopus; webofscience; ieeeexplore
2016,An Application of SMC to Continuous Validation of Heterogeneous Systems,"This paper considers the rigorous design of Systems of Systems (SoS), i.e. systems composed of a series of heterogeneous components whose number evolves with time. Such components coalize to accomplish functions that they could not achieve alone. Examples of SoS includes (among many others) almost any application of the Internet of things such as smart cities or airport management system.Dynamical evolution of SoS makes it impossible to design an appropriate solution beforehand. Consequently, existing approaches build on an iterative process that takes its evolution into account. A key challenge in this process is the ability to reason and analyze a given view of the SoS, i.e. verifying a series of goals on a fixed number of SoS constituents, and use the results to eventually predict its evolution.To address this challenge, we propose a methodology and a tool-chain supporting continuous validation of SoS behavior against formal requirements, based on a scalable formal verification technique known as Statistical Model Checking (SMC). SMC quantifies how close the current view is from achieving a given mission. We integrate SMC with existing industrial practice, by addressing both methodological and technological issues. Our contribution is summarized as follows: (1) a methodology for continuous and scalable validation of SoS formal requirements; (2) a natural-language based formal specification language able to express complex SoS requirements; (3) adoption of widely used industry standards for simulation and heterogeneous systems integration (FMI and UPDM); (4) development of a robust SMC tool-chain integrated with system design tools used in practice. We illustrate the application of our SMC tool-chain and the obtained results on a case study.",,,acm; scopus
2016,Model-Driven Performance Prediction of Systems of Systems,"Systems of Systems exhibit characteristics that pose difficulty in modelling and predicting their overall performance capabilities, including the presence of operational independence, emergent behaviour, and evolutionary development. When considering Systems of Systems within the autonomous defence systems context, these aspects become increasingly critical, as performance constraints are typically driven by hard constraints on space, weight and power.System execution modelling languages and tools permit early prediction of the performance of model-driven systems, however the focus to date has been on understanding the performance of a model rather than determining if it meets performance requirements, and only subsequently carrying out analysis to reveal the causes of any requirement violations. Such an analysis is even more difficult when applied to several systems cooperating to achieve a common goal - a System of Systems (SoS).The successful integration of systems within a SoS context has been identified as one of the most substantial challenges facing military systems development [2]. Accordingly, there is a critical need to understand the non-functional aspects of the SoS (such as quality of service, power, size, cost and scalable management of communications), and to explore how these non-functional aspects evolve under new conditions and deployment scenarios. It is crucial that we develop methodologies for modelling and understanding non-functional properties early in the development and integration cycle to better inform our understanding of the impact of emergent behaviour and evolution within the SoS.We propose an integrated approach to performance prediction of model-driven real time embedded defence systems and systems of systems [1]. Our architectural prototyping system supports a scenario-driven experimental platform for evaluating model suitability within a set of deployment and real-time performance constraints. We present an overview of our performance prediction system, demonstrating the integration of modelling, execution and performance analysis, and discuss a case study to illustrate our approach. Our work employs state-of-the-art model-driven engineering techniques to facilitate SoS performance prediction and analysis at design time, either before the SoS is built and deployed, or during its lifetime when required to evolve.Our model-driven performance prediction platform supports a scenario-driven experimental environment for evaluating a SoS within the context of a specific deployment (modelling geographical distribution) and integration constraints. The main contributions of our work are: (a) a modeling methodology that captures diverse perspectives of the performance modeling of Systems of Systems; (b) a performance analysis engine that captures metrics associated with these perspectives and (c) a case study showing the performance evaluaton of a system of systems and its evolution as a result of the performance analysis. We discuss how our approach to modelling supports the specific characteristics of an SoS, and illustrate this through a case study, based on a ""Blue Ocean"" scenario, demonstrating how we may obtain performance predictions within a SoS with emergent and evolutionary properties. Within the context of our environment, we define models for the individual systems within our System of Systems, defined for representative workload to predict execution costs, i.e. CPU, memory usage and network usage, within a generic situation. Our modelling environment supports the generation of executable forms of these models, which may then be executed above realistic deployment scenarios in order to obtain predictions of System of System performance.",10.1145/2976767.2987689,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976767.2987689,acm; googlescholar; scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2016,Conceptualizing a Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems Development and Deployment,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refer to the next generation of embedded ICT systems that are interconnected, collaborative and that provide users and businesses with a wide range of smart applications and services. Software in CPS applications ranges from small systems to large systems, aka. Systems of Systems (SoS), such as smart grids and cities. CPSoS require managing massive amounts of data, being aware of their emerging behavior, and scaling out to progressively evolve and add new systems. Cloud computing supports processing and storing massive amounts of data, hosting and delivering services, and configuring self-provisioned resources. Therefore, cloud computing is the natural candidate to solve CPSoS needs. However, the diversity of platforms and the low-level cloud programming models make difficult to find a common solution for the development and deployment of CPSoS. This paper presents the architectural foundations of a cloud-centric framework for automating the development and deployment of CPSoS service applications to converge towards a common open service platform for CPSoS applications. This framework relies on the well-known qualities of the microservices architecture style, the autonomic computing paradigm, and the model-driven software development approach. Its implementation and validation is on-going at two European and national projects.",10.1145/2993412.3004852,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2993412.3004852,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Assisting the Evolutionary Development of SoS with Reconfiguration Patterns,"System of systems (SoS) engineering is an emerging approach to deal with complex systems that have low or no control over their constituents. An SoS must adapt itself not only to the willingness of its constituents to participate or disengage, but also to evolving needs. As reconfiguration is a routine task, the SoS architect needs specific assistance, especially to easily identify reusable solution principles and to track her/his decisions in the design of reconfiguration. To address these issues, we propose to introduce the concept of reconfiguration pattern based on prior design and architectural patterns. These patterns constitute well-documented, principled and adaptable solution building blocks. We illustrate our approach with one reconfiguration pattern applied on an example based on the French communication system for emergency services.",10.1145/2993412.3004845,,acm; scopus; webofscience
2016,Synergies of System-of-Systems and Microservices Architectures,"Systems-of-Systems (SoS) are being widely embraced by both practitioners and researchers. They share properties such as distribution, evolutionary development (i.e., openness), operational and managerial independence, and emergent behavior. Those properties imply that any element (system) in an SoS is able to operate independently. Similarly, microservices are suggested as a system architecture with a strong emphasis on independence, as containers provide the required degree of isolation, and their infrastructure automation frameworks provide the means to deploy them as needed. In a microservices architecture, even data is independently managed; every service maintains its own datastore, and transaction-less interaction is emphasized. Our hypothesis in this work is that while the two approaches have been treated separately in the literature so far, they share many common characteristics, and it would be fruitful to investigate their synergies. In this paper, we analyze to what extent microservices architectures can be understood as a kind of system-of-systems, explaining some of the success of the microservices approach a consequence of their SoS properties. In addition, the best practices proposed for microservices can enable a conscious, controlled, and manageable introduction of SoS concepts into system architectures, if they are needed.",10.1145/3175731.3176176,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3175731.3176176,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Towards a Framework for Managing Inconsistencies in Systems of Systems,"The growth in the complexity of software systems has led to a proliferation of systems that have been created independently to provide specific functions, such as activity tracking, household energy management or personal nutrition assistance. The runtime composition of these individual systems into Systems of Systems (SoSs) enables support for more sophisticated functionality that cannot be provided by individual constituent systems on their own. However, in order to realize the benefits of these functionalities it is necessary to address a number of challenges associated with SoSs, including, but not limited to, operational and managerial independence, geographic distribution of participating systems, evolutionary development, and emergent conflicting behavior that can occur due interactions between the requirements of the participating systems. In this paper, we present a framework for conflict management in SoSs. The management of conflicting requirements involves four steps, namely (a) overlap detection, (b) conflict identification, (c) conflict diagnosis, and (d) conflict resolution based on the use of a utility function. The framework uses a Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute- Knowledge (MAPE-K) architectural pattern. In order to illustrate the work, we use an example SoS ecosystem designed to support food security at different levels of granularity.",10.1145/3175731.3176177,,acm; scopus; webofscience

Basically, SoS are intended to achieve performance, behavior or global goals that none of their Constituent Systems (CSs) is able to achieve independently. Some examples of SoS application domains are defense and national security, business information systems, Internet-of-Everything (IoE) and smart cities. Whereas there have been several attempts to define SoS and many designations were used to describe these complex systems composed of distributed independent CSs which interact to realize a common goal, there is yet no shared agreement on their definition [9]. However, Jamshidi's [8] definition is one of the most popular: ""SoS are large-scale, distributed, concurrent systems comprised of complex systems"". Many other researchers characterized SoS by their main features, particularly Mair specifies the following five essential characteristics referred to by the acronym OMGEE [14][12]: Operational and Managerial independence of the CSs, Geog -raphic distribution, Evolutionary development and Emergent behavior. Several other concepts could describe SoS such as: global mission, belonging, autonomy, connectivity and diversity [14].",10.1145/3175731.3176178,,acm; scopus

Understanding of missions and emergent behaviors in SoSs as well as the complicated interactions among constituent systems are a quite time demanding and challenging tasks. In another perspective, reference architectures (RAs) are a special type of software architecture that promotes reuse of knowledge to develop and evolve software systems, and mainly to promote interoperability among software systems. In spite of the relevance of RAs, these architectures have not still incorporated the concept of missions of SoSs and how to adequately manage them. Hence, such RAs have presented a limited ability to support SoSs development and evolution. In this scenario, the main contribution of this paper is to improve the feasibility of RAs in developing SoSs. For this, we present a systematic process to establish, model, and validate missions of SoSs and also incorporate them into RAs.

The emerging technologies composing systems-of-systems, such as smart objects, internet of things, context-aware and pervasive systems have increased its importance and scope. To better understand the evolution of interoperability and its influence in the building of contemporary software systems we undertook a quasi-Systematic Literature Review to collect interoperability characteristics regarding context-awareness software systems. Five dimensions (ability to exchange, cooperation, integration, system relation, and property) and seven characteristics (adaptive behavior, availability, compatibility, conformance with organization requirements, conformance with system's requirements, dynamic connection, Standardization) of interoperability emerged from the findings. They should be taken into account when developing a contemporary software system. Besides, they suggest that interoperability can be thought as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage an interaction in a system) to interact for a specific purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome.",10.1109/JSOS.2017.5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7961687/,acm; googlescholar; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Despite thorough testing of the different contributing parts, the full behavior of SoS only emerges at runtime. The systems in the SoS and their interactions thus need to be continuously monitored and checked during operation to determine compliance with requirements. In particular, after changes to one system, it is necessary to check whether the overall SoS still behaves correctly and as intended. Based on an existing monitoring framework we have been developing support for capturing and comparing event traces in SoS. Our approach facilitates and partly automates the identification of differences in event traces, which often indicate undesirable behavior introduced during evolution. In this paper we motivate the need for monitoring and evolution support in SoS using an industrial example and describe our event-based capture-and-compare approach. We evaluate the applicability and scalability of our tool-supported approach, demonstrating that it can cope with comparing event traces from an industrial SoS.

We intend this work can also inspire the opening of other related research lines towards founding the sustainability of such software-intensive systems.",10.1145/3129790.3129822,,acm; scopus; webofscience
2018,Correctness by Construction and Style Preserving Reconfigurations of System of Systems,"In distributed systems and dynamic environments, software architectures may evolve. A crucial issue when conducting system evolutions is to maintain the system in a consistent and functional state. As system complexity rises, manual checking or exhaustive model checking may be too time- and resource-consuming, lacking in scalability. This is particularly true with system of systems. Based on formal proofs in design-time, correctness by construction has recently emerged to efficiently guarantee system coherency.This article proposes a new method for the construction and specification of correct by construction system reconfigurations. Such transformations are characterized by graph rewriting rules that necessarily preserve the coherency of a system. We firstly propose operators on graph transformations and show that they conserve their correctness. Given a system specified by a graph grammar, these operators can be leveraged to construct correct transformations. We show in particular that any correct configuration can be reached starting from any other one without inconsistent intermediate step, using such transformations only.",10.1145/3167132.3167312,,acm; scopus; webofscience
2018,A Cooperative SoS Architecting Approach Based on Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems,This paper focuses on Systems of Systems (SoS) modeling and architecting. SoS architecting deals with the way that independent components of a SoS can be dynamically structured and can change autonomously their interactions in an efficient manner to fulfill the goal of the SoS and to cope with an evolving environment.In this context we defined a new model called SApHESIA (SoS Architecting HEuriStIc based on Agents) focusing on the environment and its dynamics. We also proposed a cooperative heuristic to control interactions exchanges between components. These contributions are then instantiated to a case study and evaluated through two scenarii. Obtained results are finally discussed and some perspectives are given.,10.1145/3194754.3194756,,acm; scopus; webofscience; ieeeexplore
2018,Automatic Mining of Constraints for Monitoring Systems of Systems,"The behavior of complex software-intensive systems of systems often only fully emerges during operation, when all systems interact with each other and with their environment. Runtime monitoring approaches are thus used to detect deviations from the expected behavior, which is commonly defined by engineers, e.g., using temporal logic or domain-specific languages. However, the deep domain knowledge required to specify constraints is often not available during the development of systems of systems with multiple teams independently working on heterogeneous components. In this paper, we thus describe our ongoing PhD research to automatically mine constraints for runtime monitoring from recorded events. Our approach mines constraints on event occurrence, timing, data, and combinations of these properties. The approach further presents the mined constraints to users offering multiple ranking strategies and can also be used to support users in system evolution scenarios.",10.1145/3238147.3241532,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2018,Towards a Taxonomy of Software Mediators for Systems-of-Systems,"Systems-of-Systems (SoS) refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, sometimes distributed and found in critical application domains. The independence of constituent systems brings big challenges to design SoS software architectures. Such architectures must be dynamic, evolve along the time, and allow the execution of, sometimes unknown in design time, emergent behaviours to accomplish SoS missions. Moreover, SoS architectures must connect heterogeneous systems, making possible their communication, coordination, and collaboration in a seamless way. In another perspective, mediators are architectural elements that enable required interactions among heterogeneous software entities. Despite the benefits offered by mediators, mainly at overcoming interoperability issues of software systems, no investigation has been made about which mediators can be used in SoS architectures to address challenges imposed by the nature of such heterogeneous, distributed and complex software-intensive systems. The main contribution of this paper is a taxonomy of software mediators that can be used by software architects as a library of solutions when designing their SoS. Twelve types of mediators in three categories are proposed allowing capabilities of communication and control of constituent systems' interactions, and conversion of heterogeneous messages exchanged through the mediation infrastructure. This taxonomy was established based on knowledge and experience from other types of complex systems that use mediators, and authors previous experience at architecting SoS. Categories in the taxonomy were defined based on the intrinsic characteristics of SoS architectures and well-established architectural patterns and styles. To observe the feasibility of this taxonomy, the software architecture of a Flood Monitoring System-of-Systems (FMSoS) was established using mediators as first-class software entities. Based on FMSoS architecture it was possible to have preliminary evidence to conclude that, architectures containing the proposed mediators are low coupled, support dynamic configurations during the SoS execution, and are able to address quality attributes such as flexibility, scalability, and interoperability.",10.1145/3267183.3267189,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3267183.3267189,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2018,An Acknowledged System of Systems for Educational Internet of Everything Ecosystems,"Internet of Everything (IoE) is the next evolutionary step of Internet of Things (IoT). This paradigm evolves IoT by transforming it into an accessed, monitored and controlled global pervasive network for all the Internet. The IoE network must integrate embedded devices, people, processes and data in order to provide relevant information for various application areas such as medical, industry, aerospace, agrobusiness, automation, education, among others. In this paper, we propose an acknowledged System of Systems (SoS) to integrate IoE ecosystems that operate into educational environments. This SoS implements a service-oriented architecture to provide services as interfaces between constituent systems (CS). A CS is mediated by a negotiator agent that can be requested by the SoS coordinator agent to identify the availability of specific resources demanded by other CS. This coordinator agent is responsible for recommending the CS with the best available resource for the requester CS and providing information about how access it. All the IoE components also may be mediated by intelligent agents thus increasing the robustness of an IoE ecosystem.",10.1145/3241403.3241430,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3241403.3241430,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

We describe three industrial use cases involving considerable re-architecting, where on-premises solutions were migrated to a cloud-based IoT platforms. Based on these use cases, we analyse the challenges and derive requirements for an architecture knowledge model supporting this process. The presented methodology builds upon existing approaches and proposes a model for the description of extant software applications and the management of domain knowledge. We demonstrate its use to support the evolution and/or composition of software applications in a migration scenario in a systematic and traceable manner.",10.1145/3241403.3241426,,acm; webofscience
2018,"Architecture, Technologies and Challenges for Cyber-Physical Systems in Industry 4.0: A Systematic Mapping Study","Background: The vision of a fourth industrial revolution lately strongly captured the attention of research A Cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the main drivers of this vision. Such system controls an underlying factory interacting with sensors, actuators and other systems creating systems-of-systems. A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security.Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0.Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns.Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions.Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results.

2018,Threat Analysis in Systems-of-Systems: An Emergence-Oriented Approach,"Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (SoSs) are large-scale systems made of independent and autonomous cyber-physical Constituent Systems (CSs) which may interoperate to achieve high-level goals also with the intervention of humans. Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators. The proposed methodology, as well as the tool, is empirically validated on Smart Grid case studies by submitting questionnaires to a user base composed of 3 stakeholders and 18 BSc and MSc students.",10.1145/3234513,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3234513,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Software-intensive SoS (SiSoS) has become a hotspot in the last years, from both the research and industry viewpoints. Indeed, various aspects of our lives and livelihoods have progressively become dependent on some sort of Software-intensive SoS. This is the case of SiSoS found in different areas as diverse as energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation; and applications that address societal needs, e.g. environmental monitoring, distributed energy grids, emergency coordination, global traffic control, and smart cities. Moreover, ubiquitous platforms such as the Internet of Things and nascent kinds of SoS such as Cyber-Physical SoSs are accelerating the deployment of Software-intensive SoS in the near future. Definitely, the unique characteristics of Software-intensive SoS raise a grand research challenge for the future of software-reliant systems in our industry and society due to its intrinsic features, among which evolutionary development and emergent behavior.

2019,Major Challenges of Systems-of-Systems with Cloud and DevOps: A Financial Experience Report,"The term Systems-of-Systems (SoS) refers to a complex system that comprises other systems (the constituent systems), which have operational and managerial independence, geographical distribution, emergent behavior, and evolutionary development processes. DevSecOps (or SecDevOps) offers an approach to guide the implementation of IT Processes, which in turn may support the integration of a cloud environment to a systems-of-systems environment, incorporating information security practices, as well as fostering collaboration between both development and operation teams. It also aims to promote automation of IT processes so that the development of applications and / or services is fast and secure. However, there is a lack of detail in the process definitions to guide the implementation and use of DevSecOps in a Systems-of-Systems environment, especially when it is intended to merge cloud computing into pre-existing conventional infrastructures. In this context, this paper aims at describe the main actions, concerns and lessons learned, during planning and implementation phases, about IT Processes and IT Governance Model to transform an IT traditional environment into Systems-of-Systems environment, considering DevSecOps standards in a large Brazilian financial institution. It will show how IT Processes and IT Governance Model should be changed for incorporating a Cloud environment to a SoS. For doing so, we proposed the use of DevOps techniques as a means to reduce development time without to affect the quality and information security.",10.1109/SESoS/WDES.2019.00010,,acm
2019,Emerging Structures in Information Systems: A SOS Approach,"Large industrial information systems are composed of many applications, custom-developed or COTS. Each application supports a specific business activity, and business processes are typically implemented by a distributed network of applications that evolves and grows over time. Usually, different development teams or vendors are responsible for the evolution process, each working on only part of the whole system. As a result, the organization suffers from knowledge fragmentation leading to an information system that easily evolves into a chaotic structure. In this paper, we present an experience report of developing and using SoS models of an industrial information system. Based on the insight that information systems are, by all means, systems of systems (SoS), we suggest that this view may mitigate the above stated problems. We model the information system at the SoS level of abstraction. The model appears highly complex and unmanageable. The reason is that the SoS is not designed by an external entity (a system architect) but is the result of a growing process. We research if structures are emerging from the behavior-driven evolution and detect business clusters - sets of applications/systems implementing the processes of a business area. We classify the business clusters according to their shapes and apply the concepts of cohesion/coupling to them, deriving cluster measures. We discuss some possible uses of the clusters and describe how different stakeholders really used them and have benefited from the model. As these structures are at an intermediate level of abstraction between single applications/systems and the whole information system, they help addressing the issue of knowledge fragmentation.",10.1109/SESoS/WDES.2019.00012,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2019,Risks and Assets: A Qualitative Study of a Software Ecosystem in the Mining Industry,"Digitalization and servitization are impacting many domains, including the mining industry. As the equipment becomes connected and technical infrastructure evolves, business models and risk management need to adapt. In this paper, we present a study on how changes in asset and risk distribution are evolving for the actors in a software ecosystem (SECO) and system-of-systems (SoS) around a mining operation. We have performed a survey to understand how Service Level Agreements (SLAs) -- a common mechanism for managing risk -- are used in other domains. Furthermore, we have performed a focus group study with companies. There is an overall trend in the mining industry to move the investment cost (CAPEX) from the mining operator to the vendors. Hence, the mining operator instead leases the equipment (as operational expense, OPEX) or even acquires a service. This change in business model impacts operation, as knowledge is moved from the mining operator to the suppliers. Furthermore, as the infrastructure becomes more complex, this implies that the mining operator is more and more reliant on the suppliers for the operation and maintenance. As this change is still in an early stage, there is no formalized risk management, e.g. through SLAs, in place. Rather, at present, the companies in the ecosystem rely more on trust and the incentives created by the promise of mutual future benefits of innovation activities. We believe there is a need to better understand how to manage risk in SECO as it is established and evolves. At the same time, in a SECO, the focus is on cooperation and innovation, the companies do not have incentives to address this unless there is an incident. Therefore, industry need, we believe, help in systematically understanding risk and defining quality aspects such as reliability and performance in the new business environment.",10.1145/3338906.3340443,,acm; scopus; webofscience
2019,A Systems-of-Systems Security Framework for Requirements Definition in Cloud Environment,"There are many aspects that involve the development of secure software. Regardless of the development model, the verification and validation of security must always be present, in all environments and stages. Systems-of-Systems (SoS) refer to a complex system that comprises other systems (the constituent systems), which have operational and managerial independence, geographical distribution, emergent behavior, and evolutionary development processes. By integrating cloud computing applications and services into a complex existing system, many challenges arise, especially those related to security issues. In this paper, it is proposed a security framework to guide the planning and definition phases of security requirements for SoS considering agile methods for application development and a DevSecOps approach. By using a checklist and some questions to identify which security aspects should be included, security drivers were obtained to integrate cloud computing in a SoS context, taking into account the perspectives of existing IT Governance Model, IT Operational Model, and IT Processes. Additionally, it is emphasized the need for a human resources management that aims at the positive acceptance of organizational change by all involved.",10.1145/3344948.3344977,,acm; scopus; webofscience
2020,An Ontological Architecture for Principled and Automated System of Systems Composition,"A distributed system's functionality must continuously evolve, especially when environmental context changes. Such required evolution imposes unbearable complexity on system development. An alternative is to make systems able to self-adapt by opportunistically composing at runtime to generate systems of systems (SoSs) that offer value-added functionality. The success of such an approach calls for abstracting the heterogeneity of systems and enabling the programmatic construction of SoSs with minimal developer intervention. We propose a general ontology-based approach to describe distributed systems, seeking to achieve abstraction and enable runtime reasoning between systems. We also propose an architecture for systems that utilize such ontologies to enable systems to discover and `understand' each other, and potentially compose, all at runtime. We detail features of the ontology and the architecture through two contrasting case studies: one on controlling multiple systems in smart home environment, and another on the management of dynamic computing clusters. We also quantitatively evaluate the scalability and validity of our approach through experiments and simulations. Our approach enables system developers to focus on high-level SoS composition without being constrained by deployment-specific implementation details.",10.1145/3387939.3391602,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2020,Towards Employing ABM and MAS Integrated with MBSE for the Lifecycle of SCPSoS,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are natural evolutions of embedded systems consisting of embedded computing devices and networks interacting with physical processes and possibly with a human. By introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0, CPSs are used in an interconnected way each of which may belong to a different stakeholder, building a complex System of Systems (SoS) called CPSoS. These systems need to employ some techniques to transform the collected data to knowledge with which the system can make better decisions. These capabilities can create smart CPSoS or sCPSoS.However, these systems are highly complex from both structural and behavioural point of views. Naturally, there is a need for multiple abstraction levels using different paradigms to model these system, called Multi-Paradigm modeling (MPM).In this paper, the challenges and opportunities of using agent technologies, including intelligent agents, Agent-based modeling and Simulation (ABM), and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) (or Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)) in an integrated way with Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques are discussed to cover the whole lifecycle of sCPSoS, from simulation and analysis, to development, operation and monitoring.",10.1145/3417990.3421439,,acm; scopus

Despite the benefits of the synergistic collaboration of IS, the establishment of interoperability links in the context of a SoIS is still a challenge, specially because of the characteristics of this type of complex systems, i.e., autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity, dynamism, emergent behavior, evolutionary development, interdependence. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how approaches to establish interoperability may affect these specific characteristics of SoIS. We analyzed interoperability approaches defined in ISO14258 (integrated, unified, federated) and discussed their implications in designing and managing interoperability in SoIS. We used a knowledge base containing ontological descriptions for well-known interoperability problems and their solutions to support our discussion.

Building on the basic principles of ABAC, our approach allows for a highly expressive modeling of the context in which access decisions are made, by providing mechanisms to describe rich relationships among entities, which can evolve over time.

2023,Reporting on a Decade of Promoting Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems,"Systems-of-systems (SoS) have become increasingly complex and frequently used in highly distributed, dynamic, and open environments. SoS refer to evolving software systems in which constituent systems (themselves systems in their own right) cooperatively work to fulfill specific, complex missions, facing Software Engineering researchers and practitioners with substantial challenges. Software ecosystems (SECO) have also become an important research topic, addressing social issues along with technical aspects of software development. SoS and SECO are closely related and naturally distributed in development teams. In both fields, distributed resources aim at reducing cost and reaching new Information Technology markets. Software Engineering-related problems and challenges are amplified and become more critical when SoS and SECO are analyzed together.

2023,Survey on Trust in Software Engineering for Autonomous Dynamic Ecosystems,"Software systems across various application domains are undergoing a major shift, from static systems of systems to dynamic ecosystems characterized by largely autonomous software agents, engaging in mutual coalitions and partnerships to complete complex collaborative tasks. One of the key challenges facing software engineering along with this shift, is our preparedness to leverage the concept of mutual trust building among the dynamic system components, to support safe collaborations with (possibly malicious or misbehaving) components outside the boundaries of our control. To support safe evolution towards dynamic software ecosystems, this paper examines the current progress in the research on trust in software engineering across various application domains. To this end, it presents a survey of existing work in this area, and suggests the directions in which further research is needed. These directions include the research of social metrics supporting trust assessment, fine-grained quantification of trust-assessment results, and opening the discussion on governance mechanisms responsible for trust-score management and propagation across the integrated software ecosystems.",10.1145/3555776.3577702,,acm; scopus

2022,"The future of sustainable digital infrastructures: A landscape of solutions, adoption factors, impediments, open problems, and scenarios","Background:
Digital infrastructures, i.e., ICT systems, or system-of-systems, providing digital capabilities, such as storage and computational services, are experiencing an ever-growing demand for data consumption, which is only expected to increase in the future. This trend leads to a question we need to answer: How can we evolve digital infrastructures to keep up with the increasing data demand in a sustainable way?
Objective:
The goal of this study is to understand what is the future of sustainable digital infrastructures, in terms of: which solutions are, or will be, available to sustainably evolve digital infrastructures, and which are the related adoption factors, impediments, and open problems.
Method:
We carried out a 3-phase mixed-method qualitative empirical study, comprising semi-structured interviews, followed by focus groups, and a plenary session with parallel working groups. In total, we conducted 13 sessions involving 48 digital infrastructure practitioners and researchers.
Results:
From our investigation emerges a landscape for sustainable digital infrastructures, composed of 30 solutions, 5 adoption factors, 4 impediments, and 13 open problems. We further synthesized our results in 4 incremental scenarios, which outline the future evolution of sustainable digital infrastructures.
Conclusions:
From an initial shift from on-premise to the cloud, as time progresses, digital infrastructures are expected to become increasingly distributed, till it will be possible to dynamically allocate resources by following time, space, and energy. Numerous solutions will support this change, but digital infrastructures are envisaged to be able to evolve sustainably only by (i) gaining a wider awareness of digital sustainability, (ii) holding every party accountable for their sustainability throughout value chains, and (iii) establishing cross-domain collaborations.",10.1016/j.suscom.2022.100767,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2022,Hetero-functional network minimum cost flow optimization: A hydrogen–natural gas network example,"Sustainable energy grids and networks are converging. In recent decades, cost, sustainability, and digitization drivers have caused engineering systems to evolve into systems-of-systems that deliver multiple services across multiple application domains. These engineering systems include electrified-transportation systems, the energy–water nexus, and multi-modal energy systems. The rather complex and heterogeneous interdependencies between engineering system services necessitates a precise informatic representation that ultimately supports optimized management of the holistic dynamics and tradeoffs. Consequently, ontologically-robust, quantitative modeling tools are needed to represent the heterogeneity of the modeled system-of-systems while still remaining generic and extensible to a diversity of application domains. Hetero-functional graph theory has demonstrated itself as a such modeling tool. This work now builds upon this foundation to develop a dynamic hetero-functional network minimum cost flow optimization that meets the requirements of these emerging systems-of-systems. It optimizes the supply, demand, transportation, storage, transformation, assembly, and disassembly of multiple operands in distinct locations over time in a systems-of-systems of arbitrary number, function, and topology. First, the paper introduces a general approach to define a dynamic system-of-system model that integrates customizable dynamic device models into a hetero-functional graph theory structural model. To this end, the work leverages Petri net dynamics and the hetero-functional incidence tensor. The Petri net based models are then translated into a quadratic program in canonical form. The hetero-functional network minimum cost flow optimization is demonstrated on a hydrogen–natural gas infrastructure test case. Four distinct scenarios are studied to demonstrate potential synergies and cascading network effects of policy across multiple infrastructures.",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100749,,sciencedirect; scopus

However, as more and more systems are linked together to form directed, acknowledged, collaborative, and virtual Systems-of-Systems (SoS), the exercise of control becomes problematic. Emergent properties, hostile agents, evolutionary and adaptive development, and other characteristics of systems will enable complex behaviors in SoS that are not part of the constituent systems.

2021,Transdisciplinary systems approach to realization of digital transformation,"With advancement in technology and emergence of fast networks, operation of businesses and global companies increasingly depend on the Internet and digital transformation of their infrastructures. Adaptation to Industry 4.0 paradigm gives rise to societal, technological and communication issues due to challenges in product, services, social and inter-disciplinary interactions. A more fundamental approach that can mitigate complexity of the new business is necessary. This paper adopts a system of systems model embedded into a transdisciplinary system design to describe a typical X4.0 system where X can be any industry sector migrating to Industry 4.0 paradigm. Two industry sectors: Education 4.0 and Retail 4.0 are studied under the amalgamated transdisciplinary system of systems model. Results show that the four artifacts in X4.0 can form the foundation of new sectorial 4.0 development with focus on specific elements in Cyber Physical Systems and Work4.0 artifacts. The transdisciplinary system approach has the advantage of a self-improving model that drives realization of digital transformation in evolutionary cycles.",10.1016/j.aei.2021.101316,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034621000690,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2022,Essential earth observation variables for high-level multi-scale indicators and policies,"Several holistic approaches are based on the description of socio-ecological systems to address the sustainability challenge. Essential Variables (EVs) have the potential to support these approaches by describing the status of the Earth system through monitoring and modeling. The different classes of EVs can be organized along the environmental policy framework of Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses. The EV concept represents an opportunity to strengthen monitoring systems by providing observations to seize the fundamental dimensions of the Earth system The Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is a partnership of 113 nations and 134 participating organizations in 2021 that are dedicated to making Earth Observation (EO) data available globally to inform about the state of the environment and enable data-driven decision processes. GEO is building the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, a set of coordinated and independent EO, information and processing systems that interoperate to provide access to EO for users in the public and private sectors. The progresses made in the development of various classes of EVs are described with their main policy targets, Internet links and key references The paper reviews the literature on EVs and describes the main contributions of the EU GEOEssential project to integrate EVs within the work plan of GEO in order to better address selected environmental policies and the SDGs. A new GEO-EVs community has been set to discuss about the current status of the EVs, exchange knowledge, experiences and assess the gaps to be solved in their communities of providers and users. A set of four traits characterizing an EV was put forward to describe the entire socio-ecological system of planet Earth: Essentiality, Evolvability, Unambiguity, and Feasibility. A workflow from the identification of EO data sources to the final visualization of SDG 15.3.1 indicators on land degradation is demonstrated, spanning through the use of different EVs, the definition of the knowledge base on this indicator, the implementation of the workflow in the VLab (a cloud-based processing infrastructure), the presentation of the outputs on a dedicated dashboard and the corresponding narrative through a story map. The concept of EV started in the climate sphere and spread to other domains of the earth system but less so in socio-economic activities. More work is therefore needed to converge on a common definition and criteria in order to complete the implementation of EVs in all GEO focus areas. EVs should screen the entire Earth's social-ecological system, providing a trusted and long-term foundation for interdisciplinary approaches such as ecological footprinting, planetary boundaries, disaster risk reduction, and nexus frameworks, as well as many other policy frameworks such as the SDGs",10.1016/j.envsci.2021.12.024,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience

2022,Chapter 6 - The US emergency management and public health preparedness systems,"This chapter describes how the American emergency system evolved from disorganization to the still somewhat siloed “system of systems” that it is today, with parallel public health and public safety/emergency management systems at the local (city, town, county), state, territorial or tribal, and federal levels. A bottom up system, all response begins at the local level and then moves up through the state and federal levels. Authority is diffuse; FEMA does not have the power to control state or local emergency management agencies. The federal, state and local emergency systems are explored, including key actors, organizations, and roles within the emergency lifecycle phases of mitigation-preparedness-response-recovery. The chapter describes the overall guiding principles for the US emergency system, including its “all hazards” integrated approach with a focus on commonalities among risks, and the way the system operationalizes key principles through a specific planning and emergency incident management structure and framework. Next, there is an examination of two features of the local system, the level closest to the people likely to be most directly impacted by a disaster: registries (databases with the names and addresses of people with disabilities) and medical shelters (disaster shelters separate from general population shelters). Structural challenges related to the system’s silos are discussed, along with the exclusion of disabled people from disaster planning and response processes, and a description of the federal emergency agency offices responsible for emergency management and public health preparedness compliance with and enforcement of civil rights laws.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814009-3.00004-0,,sciencedirect
2021,Alignment of the product lifecycle management federated interoperability framework with internet of things and virtual manufacturing,"The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), coupled with other capabilities such as Cloud Computing and many others, creates opportunities for the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) at the scale of a digital business ecosystem. It will impact the way engineers work when designing, developing, deploying, operating, or maintaining complex systems-of-systems, with increasing needs concerning security, agility, and interoperability. The Federated Interoperability Framework (FIF) has been developed for Aeronautic Space and Defence over the last years to prepare and build continuous operational Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) interoperability. This paper aims at illustrating, defining, and demonstrating the required evolutionary nature of the FIF from its genesis, by describing past, last, and future evolutions, in particular for the PLM Standards testbed, Virtual manufacturing and CPS.

2021,Towards Mastering Variability in Software-Intensive Cyber-Physical Production Systems,"Software-intensive Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SiCPPS), like metallurgical plants or manufacturing plants, are highly variable systems of systems that frequently evolve. They typically involve a large number of heterogeneous components (mechanical, electrical, mechatronic, software) that can be configured and combined in different ways. Variability results not only from hardware and software components but also development processes, disciplines (mechanical, electrical, software engineering), methods, and tools. Dealing with variability in industry currently depends too much on mostly tacit domain expert knowledge and custom-built tools focusing on very specific artifacts and software and hardware platforms. Existing research in the area of SiCPPS does not explicitly and systematically deal with variability. Promising software engineering methods and tools, e.g., from the area of Software Product Lines, need to be adapted for the particular challenges in SiCPPS. In this research preview paper, we discuss open research issues, research goals, and propose a research agenda towards mastering variability in SiCPPS.",10.1016/j.procs.2021.01.128,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921001666,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2023,Understanding the business model design for complex technology systems: The case of the bioeconomy,"The commercialization of bio-based technologies can foster the transition from a fossil-based to a bio-based industry. However, the development of bio-based technologies often implies a co-evolution of process and product technologies (compare for example a biorefinery producing biobased specialty chemicals) as well as the design of a larger systems architecture involving different actors. Additionally, technologies are increasingly developed in a modular design, where different components of the final technology are managed by several actors that only together engage in value-creation. Complexity of the system complicates the design of a business model due to different interdependencies and the need for co-evolution of different components of a larger technology system. To alleviate these challenges, we aim to build a framework that disentangles the interdependencies of technologies and actors as well as the inherent complexity of technology systems and guides the design of a business model for a complex technology system. By drawing upon five well-established concepts, namely (i) the technology-product-market linkages, (ii) the technology system, (iii) the system-of-systems perspective, (iv) the technology innovation system and (v) the ecosystem pie model, the proposed framework supports the design of a business model for scientist entrepreneurs of a focal technology, which aligns well with the overall (eco)system. To illustrate its use, we apply our proposed framework to the bioeconomic case of microbial palm oil produced in a biorefinery.",10.1016/j.bioeco.2023.100052,,sciencedirect
2022,The dynamics of systems integration: Balancing stability and change on London's Crossrail project,"Systems integration is essential for the design and execution of large, complex projects, but relatively little is known about how this task develops over time during the life cycle of a project. This paper builds on the concept of “disciplined flexibility” to describe how systems integration can be conceived as a dynamic process of maintaining stability, while responding flexibly to changing conditions. We examine the dynamics of systems integration through a case-study of Crossrail, the construction of London's new urban railway system, which will be called the Elizabeth Line when it opens for service. The balancing act of stability and change manifests during critical periods of the project life cycle as various interdependent systems evolve with different degrees of maturity. We identify how various types of reciprocal interdependencies in complex projects such as Crossrail – at the system and system of systems levels – require ongoing monitoring and control, and the mutual adjustment of tasks.",10.1016/j.ijproman.2022.03.007,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2022,"CPS: Role, Characteristics, Architectures and Future Potentials","CPS entails the incorporation of four key characteristic technologies. CPS device technologies, CPS computational technologies, Cyber Physical System of Systems (CPSoS) and CPS networking and communication (CPS-ComNet) technologies. Multiple CPS architectures, of which the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA), Reference Architecture Model for Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) and Intelligent Manufacturing System Architecture (IMSA) are the major referenced architectures and this demand to facilitate interoperability between such architectures for effective integration. This framework has evolved toward having smart CPS with intelligence and decision-making capabilities and highly networked and integrated components. CPSs have been categorized into two types namely Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) for the development of products and Cyber Physical Service Systems (CPSS) for the servicing of products. These developments facilitate the adoption of the CPS in smart cities, smart farming systems, smart manufacturing, and smart supply chain systems, etc., while it gives CPS the importance as one of the core technologies making up Industry 4.0 era. Despite these advances, cybersecurity and privacy, real-time control of systems, interoperability of services, etc. are key challenges facing the development of CPS and they demand solutions overcoming such challenges.

2015,Simulation of Kanban-based Scheduling for Systems of Systems: Initial Results,"Systems engineering processes for evolving systems of systems (SoS) are often software-driven and software-intensive. At the same time, SoS have multiple levels of abstraction that correspond to the various levels in the SoS hierarchy where these SoS engineering processes take place. Multiple levels of management make it difficult to capture the actual state and relative value of work in these kinds of environments. The Kanban-based scheduling system (KSS) applies lean concepts to coordinate work queues to better to address these issues. The motivation to apply agile methodologies in multi-organizational multi-level environments is based on lean principles that encourage increased visibility of work in progress, limited work in progress, and identification of issues causing blocked work. Current research is focused on formulating the KSS principles and estimating expected performance of the KSS. This paper describes the KSS work flow, Kanban scheduling principles and a simulation model designed to estimate the KSS performance.",10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002409,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2017,A system of systems framework for autonomy with big data analytic and machine learning,"Large data has been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for quite some time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data”. System of Systems (SoS) are integration of independent operatable and non-homogeneous legacy systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today’s SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable “Big Data”. Recent efforts have developed promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses machine learning tools from statistical and soft computing (SC) such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Bayesian networks, deep architectures and deep learning, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to a) extract information, b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”. This keynote attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. A photovoltaic energy forecasting problem of a micro grid SoS, traffic jams forecasting and a system of autonomous vehicles will be offered for case studies. These tools will be used to extract a nonlinear Model for a SoS-generated BIG DATA. Videos for autonomous vehicles will be shown.",10.1016/j.procs.2017.11.202,,sciencedirect
2015,The data transfer problem in a system of systems,"Systems of systems are collections of independent systems which interact and share information to provide services. To communicate, systems can opportunistically make use of contacts that occur when two entities are close enough to each other. In this paper, it is assumed that reliable predictions can be made about the sequence of such contacts for each system. An information item (a datum) is split into several datum units which are to be delivered to recipient systems. During a contact between two systems, a sending system can transfer one stored datum unit to a receiving system. Source systems initially store some of the datum units. The data transfer problem consists in searching for a valid transfer plan, i.e. a transfer plan allowing the datum units to be transmitted from their source systems to the recipient systems. The dissemination problem consists in searching a valid transfer plan which minimizes the dissemination length, i.e. the number of contacts which are necessary to deliver all the datum units to the recipient nodes. To our knowledge, there is no previous work attempting to determine the theoretical complexity of these problems. The aim of this paper is to determine the frontier between easy and hard problems. We show that the problems are strongly NP-Hard when the number of recipients is equal to 2 or more (while the number of datum units is unbounded) or the number of datum units is equal to 2 or more (while the number of recipients is unbounded). We also show that these problems are polynomially solvable when the number of datum units or the number of recipient nodes is equal to 1, or when these parameters are all upper bounded by given positive numbers. The complexity of two related problems is also studied. It is shown that knowing whether there exist k mutually arc-disjoint branchings in an evolving graph and k arc-disjoint Steiner trees in a directed graph without circuit are strongly NP-Complete.",10.1016/j.ejor.2015.01.043,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2017,1 - How Can Modeling and Simulation Help Engineering of System of Systems?,"Abstract:
In a well-known paper, Maier postulated five principal characteristics that distinguish today’s sociotechnical systems composed of existing complex systems. Those systems are called SoSs and their constituents are called CSs. SoSs are characterized by five properties: operational independence of the components, managerial independence of the components, evolutionary development, geographic distribution, and emergent behavior where the latter is explained as: “The system performs functions and carries out purposes that do not reside in any component system. These behaviors are emergent properties of the entire SoS and cannot be localized to any component system. The purposes of the SoS are fulfilled by these behaviors”.",10.1016/B978-1-78548-256-4.50001-6,,sciencedirect; scopus
2015,Flexible and Intelligent Learning Architectures for SoS (FILA-SoS): Architectural Evolution in Systems-of-Systems,"The dynamic planning for a system-of-systems is a challenging endeavor. Department of Defense (DoD) programs constantly face challenges to incorporate new systems and upgrade existing systems over a period of time under threats, constrained budget, and uncertainty. It is therefore necessary for the DoD to be able to look at the future scenarios and critically assess the impact of technology and stakeholder changes. The DoD currently is looking for options that signify affordable acquisition selections and lessen the cycle time for early acquisition and new technology addition. This paper gives an overview of a novel methodology known as the Flexible Intelligent & Learning Architectures in System-of-Systems (FILA-SoS). This approach allows for analyzing sequential decisions in evolving SoS architectures.

This paper presents a study of enabling flexibility through designing and operating systems of systems (SoSs). The paper analyzes flexibility mechanisms of SoSs and, accordingly, identifies needs for flexibility that SoSs can meet. Following that, it proposes a hierarchical network as a more flexible SoS architecture for complex or distributed large-scale systems. Then, decision problems for forming and evolving a SoS network are defined. A case that involves integrating distributed renewable energy sources with the main grid is presented to illustrate the implementation of the proposed methodology. Results from this study support the idea of acquiring and maintaining flexibility with SoSs. The paper also identifies research needs for advancing this particular use of SoSs.",10.1016/j.procs.2017.09.059,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience

Because most of the master plans are developed by an authority with significant control, which might not be true in a SoS environment. Different stakeholders might have conflicting master plans that require communication, negotiation and coordination. We propose a decentralized multi-stakeholder decision making framework where local stakeholders conduct acquisition development planning for individual benefits while the SoS-level stakeholder designs a coordination mechanism to facilitate the communication between stakeholders and further achieve a harmonious outcome. Specifically, we employ approximate dynamic programming and a transfer contract coordination mechanism to address the problem. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach through a simple illustrative example.",10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.063,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002999,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Multiobjective System of Systems Architecting with Performance Improvement Funds,"A System of Systems architecting problem aims to determine a selection of systems, which are capable of providing a set of desired capabilities. A SoS architect usually has multiple objectives in generating efficient architectures such as minimization of the total cost and maximization the overall performance of the SoS. This study formulates a biobjective SoS architecting problem with these two objectives. Here, we consider that, by allocating funds to the systems, the SoS architect can improve the performance of the capabilities the systems can provide. The resulting architecting problem is a biobjective mixed-integer linear programming model. Specifically, the system selection decisions are binary while the fund allocation decisions are continuous. We first discuss the application of the adaptive epsilon-constraint method as an exact method for solving this model. Then, we propose an evolutionary method and compare its performance with the exact method. Finally, a numerical study demonstrates the benefits of fund allocation in the SoS architecting process.",10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.301,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2014,Preparing for complex interdependent risks: A System of Systems approach to building disaster resilience,"The uncertainty posed by natural and human-made disasters arises from both known risks and a range of unforeseeable risks, some of which may be novel, not having been observed before. These interconnected risks may evolve over short periods of time and may feed into one another. In a network of multiple causes and effects, such risks may not be foreseeable at the disaster preparedness level, and may only be observed at the time of disaster response. This creates a higher level of complexity and requires new approaches with individual organizations and members needing to make decisions outside predefined frameworks and hierarchical command-control structures while still operating in the ethos of their organizations. This study advocates the need for disaster preparedness strategies to go beyond linear approaches to risk management. This is necessary in order to better address complex interdependent risks where such risks may be novel or unforeseen and which may connect in a cascading manner. The resulting causal network needs to be addressed with a networked approach to enrich existing linear approaches by recognizing the need for an interconnected holistic approach to deal appropriately with interconnected risk factors. This paper takes an interpretive perspective rather than the more typical positivist one. System of Systems (SoS) and complex systems thinking were used to inform a sense-making framework to distinguish between approaches to known/knowable and unknown risks. Finally, the paper reports on how this framework was used in South Australia on three different scales of the SoS: community, NGOs and government.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2014.05.001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420914000405,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Modeling Resilience in System of Systems Architecture,"System of Systems (SoS) can be represented by the SoS architecture which defines the constituent systems and their interfaces. SoS delivers capabilities beyond what the systems working independently can provide. Resiliency of the SoS is becoming increasingly more important and necessary for mission success. Resiliency can be defined as the ability of the SoS architecture to defend against emerging threats. This defense means adapting the SoS architecture to handle the new threat. As a new threat is uncovered, the SoS architecture evolves to a new SoS architecture resilient to the new threat. This paper presents a novel approach to modeling SoS resilience using the SoS architecture as represented in Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) views. DoDAF views are required for US DoD programs and are a way of common communication among stakeholders. This modeling approach uses an executable agent-based model of the SoS that includes the SoS architecture and possible threats. The initial SoS architecture is taken from the appropriate DoDAF views. The modeling approach introduces a threat and then adapts the SoS architecture to handle the threat. In this way, resiliency is increased. Finally, the DoDAF views are updated to reflect the newly adapted SoS architecture.",10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.300,,sciencedirect
2016,System-of-systems support — A bigraph approach to interoperability and emergent behavior,"When designing highly interactive distributed systems such as e-learning environments, a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective enables dynamic adaptation to situations of use and thus user-centeredness during operation. Each system, e.g., a mobile device for accessing a learning management system, can still be operated as a separate system, e.g., displaying the latest feedback from peers, while being run as part of a federated system, e.g., synchronizing a learning group for a tutoring session taking into account individual availability of participants. This type of coupling requires interoperability assurance of systems, in particular federating various devices and cross-over features (e.g., linking learning content to posts on social media platforms) in dynamically evolving environments. We demonstrate the utility of bigraph-based handling of SoS. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the re-specification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We show the potential of this approach orchestrating two distributed and independent systems, with orchestration enabling directly respondence to changes in a federated system's context.",10.1016/j.datak.2015.12.001,,sciencedirect; scopus
2015,The Top 10 Illusions of Systems Engineering: A Research Agenda,"Traditional systems engineering is predicated upon prediction and control. Prediction is required to attain some degree of confidence that design and manufacture decisions will yield desired results. Control is necessary to ensure that subsystems meet the needs of the overarching system. While this paradigm was successful for decades, evolving circumstances have resulted in two challenges. First, the increasing complexity of systems has eroded the system engineer's ability to predict the outcome of his or her design decisions. Second, the need to interconnect existing systems in the form of a system of systems challenges the system engineer's ability to exercise technical control because of the operational and managerial independence of the constituent systems. The application of a process predicated on invalid assumptions is not likely to achieve desirable results. This paper presents the top 10 assumptions, which are often illusory in today's systems environment. Unfortunately, our current systems engineering practices are based on heuristics dependent on many of these assumptions, often in the context of aerospace and defense programs, that have been acquired during the past half century, rather than on a solid body of scientific knowledge and are inadequate to support the discipline's necessary transformation. Consequently, research is critical to create the foundations that can support a new paradigm for systems engineering, one that is based on the reality of engineering systems in which deterministic prediction and control are no longer possible in many circumstances.",10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.033,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002690,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2015,Addressing Challenges of Ultra Large Scale System on Requirements Engineering,"According to the growing evolution in complex systems and their integrations, Internet of things, communication, massive information flows and big data, a new type of systems has been raised to software engineers known as Ultra Large Scale (ULS) Systems. Hence, it requires dramatic change in all aspects of “Software Engineering” practices and their artifacts due to its unique characteristics. Attendance of all software development members is impossible to meet in regular way and face-to-face, especially stakeholders from different national and organizational cultures. In addition, huge amount of data stored, number of integrations among software components and number of hardware elements. Those obstacles constrict design, development, testing, evolution, assessment and implementation phases of current software development methods. In this respect, ULS system that's considered as a system of systems, has gained considerable reflections on system development activities, as the scale is incomparable to the traditional systems since there are thousands of different stakeholders are involved in developing software, were each of them has different interests, complex and changing needs beside there are already new services are being integrated simultaneously to the current running ULS systems. The scale of ULS systems makes a lot of challenges for Requirements Engineers (RE). As a result, the requirements engineering experts are working on some automatic tools to support requirement engineering activities to overcome many challenges. This paper points to the limitations of the current RE practices for the challenges forced by ULS nature, and focus on the contributions of several approaches to overcome these difficulties in order to tackle unsolved areas of these solutions. As a result, the current approaches for ULS miss some RE essential practices related to find vital dependent requirements, and are not capable to measure the changes impact on ULS systems or other integrated legacy systems, in addition the requirements validation are somehow depended on the user ratings without solid approval from the stakeholders.",10.1016/j.procs.2015.09.116,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2017,Agile digital transformation of System-of-Systems architecture models using Zachman framework,"Emergent behavior is behavior of a system that does not depend on its individual parts, but on their relationships to one another. Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture: the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF) are declared inappropriate. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the Zachman Framework on the other hand are suitable. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Ultimately, SysML and UML should be integrated with the agent-based model.

2016,Genetic Algorithm Optimization of SoS Meta-Architecture Attributes for Fuzzy Rule Based Assessments,"The analysis of an acknowledged systems of systems (SoS) meta-architecture requires a preliminary method for potential trade space exploration to ensure compliance to evolving capability requirements. It is important to assess the SoS meta-architecture concept to ensure that it satisfies all stakeholder needs and requirements in the early stages of development. There are numerous linguistic terms called key performance attributes (KPAs) that could be used to assess the different aspects of the architectures capabilities, however, too many KPAs could complicate the assessment. The initial population of suitable KPAs is reduced through non-derivative based optimization employed by a genetic algorithm (GA) that generates the ideal KPA candidates though optimal rank selection. A Mamdani-type rule based fuzzy inference system (MRBFIS) is then used to make a fuzzy assessment of the SoS meta-architecture concept using GA optimized and assessed KPAs as MRBFIS inputs. The MRBFIS is a beneficial addition to an architecture assessment because it enables a nonlinear output that allows a more dynamic and adjustable assessment. The integrated assessment method detailed in this paper utilizes the GA optimized KPAs and the MRBFIS to provide a valuable fuzzy assessment of SoS meta-architecture concepts to determine if the architecture is feasible and acceptable.",10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.298,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2020,Chapter 16 - Epilogue,"Microbiomics emerged in a hazy horizon of events. The projected risk areas ranged from spoilage of homemade brews and allergies to a multitude of crude but novel engineered pathogens. This level of diffusion never happened. Human societies favored conventional technology instead of biotechnology, as nature is not the ultimate engineer, which is evident by the ongoing process of evolution. But it is a rational one. It could not employ the best materials available, as it needed sustainability for its system of systems, and autonomous reproduction, which required flexibility afforded only by the carbon chains. As microbiomics actually merge the previous collective concepts pertaining microbiology into an integrated and functional whole, thanks to Big Data, new opportunities emerge. The use of structured bioresources is much more promising for innovation. The subordinate biomes are prone to be discrete entities for quite some time for practicality purposes.

2019,Challenges for the cyber-physical manufacturing enterprises of the future,"This paper summarizes a vision of the challenges facing the so-called “Industry of the Future” as studied by the research community of the IFAC Coordinating Committee 5 on Manufacturing and Logistics Systems, which includes four Technical Committees (TC). Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.",10.1016/j.arcontrol.2019.02.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578818302086,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2020,Beyond connected cars: A systems of systems perspective,"The automotive domain is rapidly changing in the last years. Among the different challenges OEMs (i.e. the vehicle manufacturers) are facing, vehicles are evolving into systems of systems. In fact, over the last years vehicles have evolved from disconnected and “blind” systems to systems that are (i) able to sense the surrounding environment and (ii) connected with other vehicles, the city, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. Future transportation systems can be seen as a System of Systems (SoS). In an SoS, constituent systems, i.e. the units that compose an SoS, can act as standalone systems, but their cooperation enables new emerging and promising scenarios. While this trend creates new opportunities, it also poses a risk to compromise key qualities such as safety, security, and privacy. In this paper we focus on the automotive domain and we investigate how to engineer and architect cars in order to build them as constituents of future transportation systems. Our contribution is an architectural viewpoint for System of Systems, which we demonstrate based on an automotive example. Moreover, we contribute a functional reference architecture for cars as constituents of an SoS. This reference architecture can be considered as an imprinting for the implementations that would be devised in specific projects and contexts. We also point out the necessity for a collaboration among different OEMs and with other relevant stakeholders, such as road authorities and smart cities, to properly engineer systems of systems composed of cars, trucks, roads, pedestrians, etc. This work is realized in the context of two Swedish projects coordinated by Volvo Cars and involving some universities and research centers in Sweden and many suppliers of the OEM, including Autoliv, Arccore, Combitech, Cybercom, Knowit, Prevas, ÅF-Technology, Semcom, and Qamcom.",10.1016/j.scico.2020.102414,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642320300253,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2018,Lessons learned in 20 years of application of Systems Concurrent Engineering to space products,"This paper aims to present the lessons learned in 20 years of application of the SCE (Systems Concurrent Engineering) approach that evolved over the last 20 years being applied to the development of more than 200 complex system solutions. SCE is an approach to the integrated development of complex systems that applies the systems engineering process, simultaneously, to the product elements of a system solution as well as for the service elements of the system solution, recursively, at every layer of the system solution breakdown structure. The approach was born as the application of the requirements, functional and physical analysis processes to the simultaneous development of a product, its life cycle processes and their performing organizations, at every layer of the product breakdown structure. The continuous application of the approach up to 2010, showed the need to include a stakeholder analysis step, to acknowledge that the solution was comprised of product and organization elements (processes were, in fact, the functions of products and organizations), that a mission layer should be added at the top of the product breakdown structure and that the notion of circumstances should be added to the traditional notion of scenarios. With the increasing use of the approach for system of systems conception and development such as those involving multi-spacecraft solutions, the mission layer needed to be extended to include other life cycle processes (besides the operations processes) concept of service and system service architecture. This requires the development of a system solution breakdown structure that will guide the development of the overall solution. For multi-spacecraft solutions, for example, it is necessary to conceive and architect testing, launching and decommissioning services as early as operations. Also, going into more detail in the approach, modes can be derived from circumstances, interface states and internal states of the system and not only from circumstances, as initially established in the approach. These lessons to be presented were learned during the development of: 1) the Brazilian Strategic Program for Space Systems (PESE) and; 2) the TIM Project (Telematics International Mission), a satellite formation with contributions from many regions in the world.",10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.05.042,,sciencedirect
2019,Uncovering stakeholder influences in electric road systems using two assessment methods: The case of eRoadArlanda,"In Sweden, Electric Road Systems (ERS) are gaining importance in the quest for sustainable solutions for road transportation. The main driver is the 2018 Swedish climate law that requires a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 for domestic transport, excluding aviation, compared to the 2010 level. Due to the urgent need for change, the first decade of ERS evolution has been heavily focused on technological development towards a market-ready technology. Indeed, developing ERS technology is the priority of the two ERS demonstration projects on public roads in Sweden: eHighway E16 (inaugurated: 2016, status: ongoing), and eRoadArlanda (inaugurated: 2018, status: ongoing). Consequently, ERS literature reflects the empirical reality from an evidently technological focal point. However, the nature of ERS makes it a system of systems and couples a large number of stakeholders together, many of them with no previous collaboration. Thus, it is important to address ERS using a holistic focus, including social aspects. The aim of this paper is to uncover the interests and influences of different stakeholder groups in ERS development through the organisation of an ERS project as the unit of analysis. For the purpose of triangulation, the ERS stakeholders in the eRoadArlanda demonstration project have been studied in two separate studies at different points in time and using different methods prior to the comparison of findings. The first study uses interviews and an actor network analysis method to understand the ERS stakeholders' interests, influences, actions, factors and goals selections using causal maps, while the second study uses field data collection with interviews as the primary data source, as well as an iterative approach in order to discuss ERS stakeholders' interest, influence, contribution and motivation with those involved in eRoadArlanda. The findings show the different interest and influence of different stakeholders on ERS development. Further, concerns tend to differ between stakeholder groups, while contribution and motivation also vary among stakeholders within the groups.",10.1016/j.rtbm.2019.100422,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2021,Exploring the intersection between software industry and Software Engineering education - A systematic mapping of Software Engineering Trends,"Context:
Software has become ubiquitous in every corner of modern societies. During the last five decades, software engineering has also changed significantly to advance the development of various types and scales of software products. In this context, Software Engineering Education plays an important role in keeping students updated with software technologies, processes, and practices that are popular in industries.
Objective:
We investigate from literature the extent Software Engineering Education addresses major Software Engineering Trends in the academic setting.
Method:
We conducted a systematic mapping study about teaching major Software Engineering Trends in project courses. We classified 126 papers based on their investigated Software Engineering Trends, specifically Software Engineering processes and practices, teaching approaches, and the evolution of Software Engineering Trends over time.
Results:
We reveal that Agile Software Development is the major trend. The other Trends, i.e., Software Implementation, Usability and Value, Global Software Engineering, and Lean Software Startup, are relatively small in the academic setting, but continuously growing in the last five years. System of Systems is the least investigated among all Trends.

The study points out the possible gaps between Software Industry and Education, which implies actionable insights for researchers, educators, and practitioners.",10.1016/j.jss.2020.110736,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2020,SApHESIA: An agent-based model and a criticality-based heuristic for cooperatively coupling SoSs,"Problems to solve nowadays have never been so complex and are continuously increasing in complexity. In this context Systems of Systems (SoS) may be a solution but the study of such systems is far from over. An SoS is a complex system characterized by the particular nature of its components: the latter, which are systems, tend to be managerially and operationally independent as well as geographically distributed. This specific characterization led to re-think research fields of classic systems engineering, such as definition, taxonomy, modeling, architecting, etc. SoS architecting focuses on the way independent components of an SoS can be dynamically structured and can autonomously and efficiently modify their interactions in order to fulfill the goal of the SoS and to cope with the high dynamics of the environment. This paper contributes to the multi-agent and SoS research fields by proposing a new generic SoS model called SApHESIA which considers the SoS main characteristics found in the literature and extends the notion of environment and interactions between component systems. It also proposes a new SoS architecting procedure based on the Adaptive Multi-Agent System (AMAS) approach that advocates full cooperation between all the components of the SoS through the concept of criticality. This criticality is a measure, local to each component, expressing its difficulties to reach its local goals. In this procedure, the SoS architecture evolves to self-adapt to the dynamics of the environment in which it is plunged, while considering the respective local goals of its components. An instantiation of SApHESIA to two distinct cases studies from different domains (logistics and exploratory missions) is done to obtain two SoSs. These two SoS are then coupled to form a new SoS at an upper level. Evaluations of these SoSs show that their cooperation make each of them more efficient.",10.1016/j.scico.2020.102533,,sciencedirect
2018,"Simultaneously acting network layers in an IEC 61499 modeling system at the example of Eclipse-4DIAC, the cloud-oriented MSB and XML-RPC","As modern control systems in manufacturing evolve into highly grained and split up systems of systems, two special demands appear: Initially, such systems of systems require flexible communication structures in order to provide not only communication between strongly different controlling components but also communication with higher-level systems. Communication with higher-level systems is strongly demanded because of the desire to digitally represent the systems of systems. Besides this, software tools which allow comprehensible modelling, configuring and programming of distributed systems are needed too. These software tools must also control the communication structures. This paper shows the implementation and usage of two different means of communication specifications as layers in the IEC 61499 based modelling system 4DIAC. The implementation shall be an example of how the two mentioned demands can be met.",10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.143,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2018,Integrating small satellite communication in an autonomous vehicle network: A case for oceanography,"Small satellites and autonomous vehicles have greatly evolved in the last few decades. Hundreds of small satellites have been launched with increasing functionalities, in the last few years. Likewise, numerous autonomous vehicles have been built, with decreasing costs and form-factor payloads. Here we focus on combining these two multifaceted assets in an incremental way, with an ultimate goal of alleviating the logistical expenses in remote oceanographic operations. The first goal is to create a highly reliable and constantly available communication link for a network of autonomous vehicles, taking advantage of the small satellite lower cost, with respect to conventional spacecraft, and its higher flexibility. We have developed a test platform as a proving ground for this network, by integrating a satellite software defined radio on an unmanned air vehicle, creating a system of systems, and several tests have been run successfully, over land. As soon as the satellite is fully operational, we will start to move towards a cooperative network of autonomous vehicles and small satellites, with application in maritime operations, both in-situ and remote sensing.",10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.01.022,,sciencedirect
2019,A modeling approach for Systems-of-Systems by adapting ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 Standard evaluated by Goal-Question-Metric,"Context. Systems-of-Systems (SoS) constitute a new category of complex software systems resulting from the integration of independent heterogeneous systems. Each constituent system has its own purpose and could interact with other systems to achieve a common goal. SoS have specific characteristics, namely operational and managerial independence of constituent systems, geographic distribution, evolutionary development and emergent behaviors. Due to the complexity of SoS, their development demands special attention to their software architecture description. Objective. In this work, we aim to elaborate an approach for modeling SoS using an Architecture Description Languages (ADL) adequate with SoS' characteristics. In fact, many researches have addressed the problem of describing the software architecture of SoS. However, there is still a lack of ADL having the expressive power to describe SoS software architectures. Method. To address this problem, we proposed an approach based on the standard “ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010: Systems and software engineering- Architecture Description” to describe the software architectures of SoS. Then, we proposed improvements for this standard to be adequate with SoS characteristics. Finally, we conducted a qualitative study based on Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) with a focus group to evaluate the effectiveness of this work. Results. While applying our approach in an illustrative case study which is an SoS entitled Smart City, we modeled three viewpoints for our SoS, expressing its specific characteristics; structural viewpoint, behavioral viewpoint and requirement viewpoint. Each one of these viewpoints is illustrated via an architecture model modeled by multi-labeled graphs which represent an intuitive and formal ADL. The use of multi-labeled graphs allowed as to check the conformity of the obtained architecture models with design rules via the Graph Matching and Transformation Engine (GMTE). Conclusions. It is concluded that the proposed improvements for the standard are important to express specific characteristics of SoS. Moreover, our proposed formal ADL, entitled multi-labeled graphs, allows us to elaborate different models considering different viewpoints to describe the SoS' architecture. Finally, it is important to investigate larger SoS and to conduct a quantitative study to further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.",10.1016/j.scico.2019.102305,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642319301030,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2019,Historical survey and emerging challenges of manufacturing automation modeling and control: A systems architecting perspective,"An architecting perspective is derived as part of a more global perspective, related to manufacturing automation modeling and control through four industrial revolutions. This historical survey (Pereira et al., 2017) highlights the impact of digitalization both on isolated machines and devices, and on the architecting of large-scale manufacturing and logistics systems. To distribute the holistic control over related components, two main paradigms have been followed for the engineering of those System of Systems (SoS): (1) technology-enhanced, and (2) bio-inspired. In both, the cognitive orchestration of the knowledge and skills involved in a system project remains challenging for the interdisciplinary togetherness and harmony required beyond the disciplinary boundaries.

2020,Automated reasoning framework for traceability management of system of systems,"An important aspect in system of systems (SoS) is the realization of the capabilities in different systems that work together. Identifying and locating these capabilities are important to orchestrate the overall activities and hereby to achieve the overall goal of the SoS. System elements and capabilities in SoS however, are rarely stable and need to evolve in different ways and different times in accordance with the changing requirements. To manage the SoS and cope with its evolution it is necessary that the dependency links to the capabilities and the system elements can be easily traced. Several approaches have been proposed to model traceability and reason about these by extending a predetermined set of possible trace links with fixed semantics. However, for the context of SoS a fixed traceability model with fixed traceability semantics is limited to consider the various different and changing scenarios. In this article, we first present the different traceability requirements for managing traceability in the context of SoS. Subsequently, we present the metamodel and the corresponding domain specific language to support modeling traceability and traceability analysis approaches within the evolving SoS context. Further, we provide the tool support for automated reasoning of traceability of SoS capabilities and system elements. We illustrate and discuss the approach for the application to a smart city SoS.",10.1016/j.scico.2020.102416,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience

2017,Service Oriented Architecture enabling the 4th Generation of District Heating,"The 4th Generation of District Heating (4GDH) is a complex agglomeration of heat providers, distributors, and consumers that must be automatically, continuously managed and coordinated. It is a complex system of systems; a definition which we align to Maier's architecting principles for systems-of-systems as collaborative systems. Wrapped in the idea of system of systems is the reality that the 4GDH systems’ descriptions and specifications are not currently all known. Nonetheless, the transition into the 4GDH is actual. We propose the use of two frameworks to secure a smooth metamorphosis and assure systems’ operation, maintenance, and evolution. The two frameworks are the Arrowhead Framework and the OPTi Framework. The first one enables system integration through Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the second one offers the overall system optimization with respect to all stakeholders. This paper uses the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tool SysML to model a district heating complex's structures and behaviors from the concept level down to the sensors and actuators within a district heating substation where we apply the SOA technology based on the open Arrowhead Framework. We focus on the Arrowhead Framework's core services, i.e. Service Registry, Authorization and Orchestration to clearly describe the interactions between the different service providers and consumers. Going back up from the sensors to the systems, it is clear that SOA is the architecture that will empower the 4GDH.",10.1016/j.egypro.2017.05.096,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2019,System of Systems (SoS) Architecture for Digital Manufacturing Cybersecurity,"Technology advancements of real time connectivity and computing powers has evolved the way people manage activities triggering heavy reliance on smart devices. This has reshaped the ability to memorize crucial information, instead accumulate the information into devices allowing real-time fingertip access when needed. Inability to access such information when needed is routinely assumed with device malfunctioning bypassing the probability of compromise, but what if the information is now being accessed by adversaries depriving the data-owner access to crucial information? Cyber manufacturing systems are not immune from these issues. It is possible to approach this problem as generating SoS meta-architecture. In this paper a model is developed using SoS Explorer tool developed by Engineering Management and Systems Engineering that demonstrates the concern on a notional banking cybersecurity problem. Solution that generates a meta-architecture is achieved through Genetic Algorithm (GA) using fuzzy assessor as a fitness function to select combinations of defense mechanism constituents.",10.1016/j.promfg.2020.01.248,,sciencedirect
2020,Exploring the characteristics and utilisation of Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) in Germany,"Digitisation in Agriculture is currently one of the most important ongoing developments to meet the growing economic, ecological and social demands in the agri-food sector in Germany. Consequently, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to collect, exchange and evaluate data from and between different stakeholders and systems has already established itself in the agricultural sector. However, the extent to which information systems are used and the kind of features they have at the farm enterprise level are not clear. To obtain further insight into this topic, a quantitative empirical approach was adopted. It was based on interview data from a web-based survey conducted throughout Germany at the beginning of 2018. In this survey, 329 questionnaires (representing an 8.4% response rate) were completed and evaluated using bivariate and multivariate methods. This paper aims to assign the surveyed farmers to two of the “five steps of digital evolution” model - from the “single product” to the “system of systems” - according to the stated characteristics and functions used in the Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS). According to that model, a single product (e.g. a tractor or a feed trough) develops at level 1 and becomes a “smart product” at level 2. The agricultural machine can now, for example, maintain precise tracking via integrated real-time kinematic (RTK) correction that enhances precise satellite navigation. At the third development stage, a “smart, connected product” is created, where the agricultural machine is networked with other systems. Level 4 represents an “intelligent product system”. The focus is no longer only on optimising a single process, but also on optimising process chains. At the last stage, “systems of systems” (i.e. “smart farming”), the networking of different data from diverse sources reaches the maximum level. 43 variables were used to conduct a two-step cluster analysis, in which two clusters could be identified within the sample. The farmers assigned to cluster 2 could be determined as “users of smart products” (58%) which represents level 2 of the model. These farmers are characterised by the fact that they use FMIS for the overall purpose of supporting the documentation, monitoring and planning of farm management processes. The highest level of digitisation in German agriculture was found to match level 3, what is known as “users of smart, connected products”. On this level, farmers that were assigned to the cluster 1 (42%) use their information systems to improve individual farm processes by connecting hardware, sensors, data storage and software in different ways.",10.1016/j.compag.2020.105246,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169919316126,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,"Integrated Analysis of Functional and Developmental Interdependencies to Quantify and Trade-off Ilities for System-of-Systems Design, Architecture, and Evolution","When complex systems and systems-of-systems are involved, the behavior of the whole entity is not only due to that of the individual systems, but also to the interactions and interdependencies between the systems. Classical systems engineering approach is not always suitable to manage such feature, and new tools and methods are required, capable to identify, analyze and quantify properties of the system-of-systems as a whole. This research addresses the need to deal with complex dependencies between systems, in both developmental and functional relationships. We propose a combination of two previously developed methods, to analyze functional and developmental dependencies between systems in a system-of-systems, and to assess the impact of such dependencies on metrics that characterize global prop erties of a system-of-systems over its life span known as ilities. The analysis can be used to drive decisions for system-of- systems design, architecture, and evolution, with respect to the identified metrics of interest. It also accounts for the presence of multiple stakeholders, and external factors that influence the operability and the development of a system-of-systems. The methods support the analysis of trade-offs between competing ilities and facilitates identification of better performing architectures. We show preliminary results of the application of the methods, and how the results can be interpreted to evaluate system-of-system ilities on synthetic problems.

Utilizing a standard 802.11 ad hoc protocol set, the network can be understood in terms of its capabilities and limitations. Agent based modeling facilitates the individual autonomy aspect of system of systems participants and is responsible for determining how a node will use the 802.11 protocol.

2013,Assessment of stakeholder perceptions in water infrastructure projects using system-of-systems and binary probit analyses: A case study,"Globally, water management is evolving toward integrating participatory processes for decision-making to increase the sustainability of the decision outcome. Information about the perceptions and concerns of stakeholders needs to be readily available to those involved in the decision-making process early in the planning stage to assist in developing viable alternatives that may be implementable with limited public opposition and engender general consensus among stakeholders. The current literature does not identify an appropriate means to incorporate stakeholder views early in the preliminary planning stages without requiring relatively large time commitments or the physical presence of the key stakeholders for meetings and discussions. This study develops and demonstrates a decision-support framework that incorporates the system-of-systems school of thought with binary probit analysis to aid in efficient participatory processes by providing insight regarding the stakeholders' demographics and select behavioral characteristics in a decision-making process. The methodology first frames the water system as a system-of-systems, an approach that inherently pinpoints the necessity for diverse stakeholder involvement and maps the stakeholders in the system's hierarchy. Then, binary probit analyses are used to quantify the effect of stakeholder characteristics on the likelihood that (1) they perceive or do not perceive a need for new capital-intensive water infrastructure, and (2) they support or oppose new capital-intensive water infrastructure. A water system decision in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta serves as a case study to demonstrate the methodology.

2013,Development Interdependency Modeling for System-of-Systems (SoS) using Bayesian Networks: SoS Management Strategy Planning,"Managing the development and evolution of a system-of-systems (SoS) capability remains a challenge due to, among other reasons, the complex interdependencies between participating systems. One form of complexity stems from the tendency of interdependencies to propagate between systems; disruptions in the development of one system may propagate to other dependent systems in successive cycles, creating schedule and cost overruns. Event tree methods and Bayesian Networks (BNs) are used in this paper to quantify development interdependencies between systems and assess cascading development risks. In addition the approach also allows inputs (e.g. development failure rates of participating systems) to be updated automatically for better decision-making. A primary output of the approach is the quantification of development interdependencies and the identification of critical systems with respect to propagating effect levels. This method when applied to a synthetic problem, as a proof-of- concept, demonstrates the robustness of the proposed approach in tackling risk interaction that arises from the cascading effects of development disruptions and clearly illustrates that the propagating effects depend not only on SoS architecture, but on development failure rates of participating systems as well. The outcomes of the analysis provide a support for decision makers to manage risk in development of a SoS with complex interdependencies.",10.1016/j.procs.2013.01.073,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050913000744,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2011,"Societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in European Seas","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",10.1016/j.pocean.2011.05.001,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2012,Multi-agent Architecture with Space-time Components for the Simulation of Urban Transportation Systems,"Transportation systems are increasingly complex and must evolve to incorporate components of sustainable development. It has become appropriate to develop high-level simulation tools for policy makers so that they can analyze the potential consequences of their choices. In this paper, we propose a decision-maker simulator intended to define and tune urban transportation policy (travel, parking and transportation strategies). In terms of system architecture, we adopted a “system of systems” approach, mainly structured in layers, in order to model the main elements of the system. We represent explicitly, for example, a layer of roads, lights, parking, means of transport, etc. Our system uses an agent-based simulation incorporating spatial and temporal information. It must support the regulatory scenarios to simulate the effect of regulatory strategies on transportation systems. The paradigm of multi-agent systems is well suited for simulating the behavior of the components of an urban transportation system. Existing applications address problems of individual behavior management, management of traffic flows, management of temporal and geographical aspects, multi-modality transport, etc. However, they don’t address organizational aspects of transportation systems that incorporate the adaptability of users’ behavior. In addition, we implemented the mechanism of “traces”; the trace files contain the result of simulation. Travel surveys, census and traffic measurements were used. Analysis of available data and traces were used to evaluate the suitability of our simulations according to different regulatory strategies. Finally, we implemented a prototype for the movement of people in the city of La Rochelle from statistical data of INSEE (the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) and the BD TOPO 2 of the IGN (the French National Geographical Institute) using the GAMA platform.",10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.756,,sciencedirect; webofscience
2012,A contribution of system theory to sustainable enterprise interoperability science base,"Even if the research domain related to interoperability has been developed for more than 10years and particularly for the last 8years, the different kinds of interoperability and the different problems to solve need to be consolidated in order to define a real science. Moreover, because of the continuous evolution of enterprises in supply chains, interoperability problems must continuously be considered and solved in order to reach a sustainable interoperability. The objective of this prospective research paper is to discuss how system theory (ST), applied to system of systems, is able to support the development of sustainable enterprise interoperability science base. After an introduction which reminds the definition of enterprise interoperability and the development of this domain in Europe, the system theory concepts are introduced. Then, the requirements are described to support the determination of the necessary concepts to develop a science base for sustainable enterprise interoperability. This part also describes how the concepts of system theory meet the defined requirements. The fourth part presents a specific approach based on system theory in order to manage the evolution of interoperability in enterprises and to reach sustainable interoperability.

2014,System of Systems and Big Data analytics – Bridging the gap,"Large data has been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for quite some time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data”. System of Systems (SoS) integrate independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today’s SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable “Big Data”. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation (such as genetic algorithms), Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to (a) extract information, (b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and (c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”. This paper demonstrates how to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. The subject material for this demonstration is using data analytics to generate a model to forecast produced photovoltaic energy to assist in the optimization of a micro grid SoS. Tools like fuzzy interference, neural networks, PCA, and genetic algorithms are used.",10.1016/j.compeleceng.2013.11.016,,sciencedirect
2010,"Observation Needs for Climate Information, Prediction and Application: Capabilities of Existing and Future Observing Systems","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.",10.1016/j.proenv.2010.09.013,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2011,Engineering Self-Designing Enterprises as Complex Systems Using Extended Axiomatic Design Theory,"Abstract
The paper proposes an approach for designing complex enterprises as systems of systems that on each level of hierarchy have a (recursive) self-designing property. A definition of self-evolving / self-designing systems is given using the notion of life cycle relationships as defined in ISO 15704:2000 and is presented in a form for practical use in enterprise engineering. The approach is based on an extension of Nam Suh's axiomatic design, by introducing a third design axiom, the ‘axiom of recursion'. It is argued that (under certain circumstances) by distributing the design authority between systems on each level, it may be possible to limit the complexity of the system that any design authority needs to see.",10.3182/20110828-6-IT-1002.01907,,sciencedirect; scopus
2013,An Approach to Facilitate Decision Making on Architecture Evolution Strategies,"The evolution of System of Systems (SoS) architectures is a difficult process due to the complex interactions between entities that exist in an SoS. Adequate tools are thus needed in capturing these interdependencies to support informed decisions on architectural evolutions. In this paper, an approach is introduced to facilitate decision making on architecture evolution strategies. The main purpose of evolving architecture is to satisfy advanced capability and performance objectives through adding new systems, replacing existing systems, changing links, etc. The paper employs Colored Petri Nets (CPN), a powerful discrete event dynamic simulation tool, to model, simulate and evaluate the existing and evolving architectures. However, it is unrealistic to improve performance without considering the cost of architecture evolutions. This paper regards complexity as an indicator of the architecture evolving cost. Compared to other complexity metrics, dynamic complexity is included in the complexity metric in this paper. Eventually, an appropriate evolution choice could be achieved by examining the tradeoff space between complexity and performance. This approach is illustrated with a conceptual SoS problem.",10.1016/j.procs.2013.01.029,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2014,An Analytic Portfolio Approach to System of Systems Evolutions,"The development of large collections of systems or a ‘System-of-Systems (SoS)’ is challenging due to the large number of systems involved, complex dynamics attributed to interdependencies between systems, and inherent technical and programmatic uncertainties. The sheer number of decision variables involved in SoS development exceeds the mental faculties of the SoS practitioner, prompting the need for effective analytical support frameworks. Current frameworks and guidelines in addressing SoSE challenges lack analytical means of objective SoS level decision-making. Research in this paper adopts computational decision support methods from financial engineering that allows SoS practitioners the means to identify optimal ‘portfolios’ of systems based on dimensions of capability, cost and operational risk. The SoS architecture is represented as a hierarchical collection generic nodes that interact to provide the overarching SoS level set of capabilities based on an archetypal set of inter- nodal behaviors. Our research leverages a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) perspective to managing risks that can incorporate agent based simulation data in the decision-making process. We demonstrate the method using a LCS inspired Naval Warfare Scenario (NWS) as an illustrative case study.",10.1016/j.procs.2014.03.085,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914001483,sciencedirect; scopus; googlescholar
2011,A review and outlook for a ‘Building Information Model’ (BIM): A multi-standpoint framework for technological development,"This study provides a review of important issues for ‘Building Information Modelling’ (BIM) tools and standards and comprehensive recommendations for their advancement and development that may improve BIM technologies and provide a basis for inter-operability, integration, model-based communication, and collaboration in building projects. Based on a critical review of Building Product Modelling, including the development of standards for exchange and the features of over 150 AEC/O (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) tools and digital models, a methodological framework is proposed for improvements to both BIM tools and schemata. The features relevant to the framework were studied using a conceptual process model and a ‘BIM System-of-Systems’ (BIM-SoS) model. The development, implementation, and use of the BIM Schema are analysed from the standpoint of standardisation. The results embrace the requirements for a BIM research methodology, with an example of methods and procedures, an R&D review with critique, and a multi-standpoint framework for developments with concrete recommendations, supported by BIM metrics, upon which the progress of tools, models, and standards may be measured, evaluated, streamlined, and judged. It is also proposed that any BIM Schema will never be ‘completed’ but should be developed as evolutionary ontology by ‘segmented standpoint models’ to better account for evolving tools and AEC/O practices.",10.1016/j.aei.2010.06.003,,sciencedirect
2014,On the Flexibility of Systems in System of Systems Architecting,"System of Systems (SoS) architecting requires analyzing a set of individual but interconnected systems simultaneously in order to build a communicating SoS, which can provide the capabilities needed. In general, the systems can provide a set of capabilities and the SoS architect needs to decide which systems to include in the SoS so that each capability is provided by at least one system. In this case, the systems are inflexible, i.e., a selected system will contribute to the SoS with all the capabilities it can provide. On the other hand, if SoS architect can incentivize systems to contribute specific capabilities instead of all its capabilities, it might be possible to build a better SoS in terms of not only one objective but all objectives considered. In this study, we compare SoS architecting with inflexible and flexible systems and quantify the value of the flexibility of the systems for a military application. Two evolutionary algorithms are constructed for the SoS architecting with inflexible and flexible systems for the resulting multi-objective optimization problems. These evolutionary algorithms output a set of Pareto efficient SoS's for the architect. Upon comparing the Pareto fronts of inflexible and flexible models, we quantify the value of systems’ flexibilities. It is demonstrated that SoS architecting with flexible systems can improve performance while decreasing costs.",10.1016/j.procs.2014.09.038,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914012873,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2013,Using Architecture Patterns to Architect and Analyze Systems of Systems,"The inherent nature of a Systems of Systems (SoS) makes it very difficult to model and analyze it through conventional means. One of the first challenges faced is how to represent the SoS in a form that lends itself to detailed analysis, especially when full details of the component systems may not be readily available. Therefore, an important consideration is whether use of model abstractions can be sufficient to deal with many of the analysis needs of the SoS. It is clear there is a need for a new paradigm, encompassing methodology, models, tools and flows that enable the future engineering of SoS in order that they can be operated effectively. This paper describes how we are using architecture patterns to architect and analyze SoS in order that we can compare different architecture solutions and provide guidelines for the development of a future architectures based on the analysis of existing architectures. Insights are given to show the benefits for SoS architecture analysis with exemplars taken from a test case dealing with emergency response for a major incident in the UK. Our findings show the significant increase in SoS characterization that patterns can afford the systems architect in all phases of SoS evolution in order to deliver improved SoS capability.",10.1016/j.procs.2013.01.030,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050913000318,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,An Analytic Workbench Perspective to Evolution of System of Systems Architectures,"The development of a large group of interdependently operating systems, or ‘System of Systems (SoS)’, presents significant challenges across technical, operational and programmatic dimensions. Trades between cost, schedule, performance, and associated spectrum of risks, are essential during analysis of alternatives for both individual systems and the SoS architecture as a whole. The large number of decision variables involved, ubiquitous uncertainty and complex interactions that exist between systems creates analysis problems that go well beyond the immediate mental faculties of decision-makers. Often times, the decisions made focus on localized development at the systems level with little consideration for cascading effects on the bigger SoS picture. Hence, the process of evolving SoS architectures requires tools that provides the SoS practitioner with meaningful analytical quantifications of the SoS tradespace. In the defense arena, existing tools for such trades, have been guided by policies set forth in the Defense Acquisitions Guidebook (DAG) (5000 series) and the System Engineering Guide for System of Systems (SoS-SE), but are lacking an analytic perspective towards more informed decision-making. This paper discusses a multidisciplinary effort, funded by the DoD's Systems Engineering research Center (SERC), to establish an analytic workbench of computational tools to facilitate better-informed decision-making on SoS architectures. The work is motivated by the idea that SoS practitioners possess relevant information and archetypal questions that reflect desired outcomes at the SoS level. These archetypal, technically -driven queries are mapped to relevant methods that can provide analytical outputs to directly support SoS acquisition and architectural decisions. The applicability and respective value-added of each method in addressing various archetypal measures are presented.",10.1016/j.procs.2014.03.084,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914001471,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2004,Military technology: an historical perspective,"Throughout history, nations have endeavored to develop new and more advanced technologies with the goal of achieving military advantage. New technologies resulted in new weapons and brought dramatic change in military tactics. The increase in the destructive power of soldiers in the Civil War and the resulting horror and futility of the frontal assault ushered in a change to trench warfare. The military aircraft, tanks, and the newly developed radio and radar made a new kind of dynamic warfare possible during World War II. World War II ended with a remarkable technological achievement: the development of the atomic bomb. In response, the Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb in 1949, followed by their successful test of a hydrogen bomb. By the early-1950s, missile programs were underway in both countries. In the absence of knowledge, the American threat assessments, and therefore the American response, were based on worst-case scenarios. The response of the Soviet Union was also based on their worst-case scenarios. Recognizing the dangers of this arms race in the dark, President Eisenhower authorized the secret development of a new generation of sensors and reconnaissance satellites, the successors of which are still vital to our security. Then, in response to the Soviet quantitative advantage in military forces, the US conceived a new “system of systems” of intelligence sensors, smart weapons and stealth aircraft. These new systems were developed during the late-1970s, produced in the early-1980s, and entered into the force in the late-1980s—just in time for Desert Storm. Today the threat of terrorism and the threat of proliferation are the greatest threats to our security. It seems likely that the American military will remain the dominant military force in the world for the foreseeable future, but this can have unintended consequences. It can lead to a nightmare scenario where a terror group may attack us with weapons of mass destruction. Advanced information technology is critical to countering this threat. There are technological opportunities in all the components of homeland security: intelligence, prevention, protection of infrastructure, detection of attacks, and consequence management. But these improvements will not evolve automatically. It is boldness and single-minded dedication that we must summon to respond to the threat of weapons of mass destruction in our cities. We must mobilize the scientific community as was done in World War II and in the Cold War.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2004.01.035,,sciencedirect; scopus
2014,Systems of systems: The Innovation phase - How are they born?,"In the last ten years there is an increased interest in System of Systems (SoS). The availability and affordability of communication made many systems to connect to each other and create networks with different stakeholders who collaborate to achieve common goals. There are many examples of SoS around us and they are part of our everyday life such as: Net Centric Warfare (NCW) System, transportation, electric grid, hotel chains, navigation, banking etc ... are all Systems of Systems. Communication, computers and miniaturization are the key enablers which are driving the evolution of systems into SoS. Those technologies are accelerating the high connectivity between many types of systems, data bases, processes and stakeholders. The medium and large systems integrators industries have a growing interest in SoS. As they are always trying to move upwards the value chain in order to maintain their survivability and growth. Since systems are part of SoS even small companies must understand the new environment of SoS. To maintain growth companies must seek for introducing new systems, capabilities or processes to the market. Today this innovation phase is done in the environment of SoS. Shumpeter claims that companies and even societies must innovate and introduce new systems in order to survive. This leads to the following most critical questions: How a System of Systems is born? What are the innovation processes the industry has to exercise in order to develop a new SoS? Are those processes similar to system's innovation? Or there are differences? - Those are important issues to be addressed by the academy and also by the industry in order to maintain their growth in a new world of complex SoS. Despite its importance and criticality there is not much in the literature about the innovation phase of SoS. In this paper we will discuss how Systems of Systems are born and in what aspect they are differ from Systems from the innovation point of view.

2014,Keynote: From embedded systems to systems of systems,"Summary form only given, as follows. Most of today,s machines, e.g., automotive engines, production machinery or even consumer devices, such as a washing machine, are controlled by an embedded computer system. It is assumed that the widespread integration of these existing embedded computer systems and data bases into systems-ofsystems (e.g., the Internet of Things, IoT) will provide new synergistic services, make better use of the available information, lead to new insights, improve current economic processes and thus create greater wealth. Fueled by the dramatic technological progress in the area of wire-bound and wire-less communication, this integration is already happening on a wide scale in industry. From the viewpoint of computer science, the domain of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a relatively new field that poses significant new research challenges. In our view, the differentiating characteristics of a SoS compared to a monolithic system are the autonomy of the Constituent Systems (CS), emergent phenomena at the SoS level, uncoordinated evolution of the CSs and most, importantly, that the occurrence of faults in the CSs must be considered normal during the operation an SoS. This presentation will focus on the issues that are posed by the integration of embedded systems into systems of systems and will refer to the research approach taken in the European AMADEOS project 610535 (Architecture for Multi-criticality Agile Dependable Evolutionary Open System-of-Systems).

While this generated a large number of novel and valuable techniques, tools, and methodologies in System-of-Systems Engineering, it also broadened the problem domains, and subsequently made it difficult to achieve a high degree of coordination and cohesion in the discipline. Previous attempts at creating a formal structure to System-of-Systems Engineering provided valuable support to practitioners, but have been sometimes disconnected from the current practical needs in the discipline, leaving behind some pain points that still need to be addressed. In this work, we propose a different perspective to deal with the pain points: based on our experience and on analysis of the current challenges of System-of-Systems Engineering, we identify potential research directions which are based on domain-agnostic methodology, but of interest to a variety of problems in System-of-Systems.

Many definitions have emerged, most of them depending on the characteristics of the domain where this notion is linked. This paper considers the notion of SoS as an evolution of the standard notion of systems and aims to provide a definition that is detached from the particular domain. We deal first with the fundamental components of the system, describe the different aspects of the structure of a composite system and then we provide an explanation of the difference of the new notion, to the standard notion of Composite Systems. We present a new abstract definition of the notion of SoS as an evolution of the notion of Composite Systems, empowered by the concept of autonomy and participation in tasks usually linked to games. This is a development of the Composite System notion where now the subsystems act as autonomous intelligent agents in a multi-agent system that is defined by a central task and possibly a game.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5665614/,ieeeexplore; scopus; googlescholar
2010,Interaction-based Runtime Verification for Systems of Systems Integration,"Complex distributed systems pose great challenges for quality assurance. Size, complexity and concurrency of these systems often render traditional verification techniques impractical. In particular, this is true for systems integration efforts, where additional challenges arise from the independent evolution of the composed systems. Runtime verification provides a systematic strategy for analytical quality assurance of such systems. Key elements of runtime verification are system models, ways to inject these models into the observed system and a framework for analysing and monitoring the runtime behaviour against the models. The approach we present in this article is based on interaction models. We specify expected system interactions using Message Sequence Charts (MSC), from which we generate distributed runtime monitors for each of the components. We use aspect-oriented programming (AOP) techniques to inject the monitors into the implementation of the components. Thereby, we verify the adherence of the distributed system interactions with the MSC model. The focus of this article is the runtime verification in the systems integration domain; here, Enterprise Service Buses (ESB) have emerged as a powerful infrastructure for integrating complex distributed systems. In the context of an ESB we leverage the Spring AOP framework to inject the runtime monitors. As a result we obtain a comprehensive, tool-supported approach for model-based runtime verification of interactions. We demonstrate our approach using the Central Locking System as running example of an integrated embedded system.",10.1093/logcom/exn079,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8133355/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

The complexity of systems will increase objectively, which is a risk when it is approached incorrectly, but an opportunity when approached in the right way.

This paper presents a novel approach to evolve remote sensing application as a System-of-Systems (SoS). Bringing in the SoS perspective provides additional insights into the dynamics of the interactions between the various constituent systems (e.g. swarm UAVs, Ground stations) and the impact on the overall remote sensing application.

The reality of 21st century software development is that software itself is but one part of a complex system-of-systems that includes a broad technological infrastructure along with a wide set of human activities. The technological systems and the human activity systems have a symbiotic relationship - each shapes the other in complex ways, such that neither can be understood in isolation. A recent report from the SEI on ultra-large scale (ULS) systems accurately characterized the nature of these systems-of-systems: they have no centralized control; experience normal failures and continual evolution of heterogeneous elements; and their requirements are inherently conflicting, diverse and often unknowable. For design purposes, the boundary between people and software disappears - design is as much about shaping the human activities as it is about constructing the software",10.1109/ICCBSS.2007.32,,ieeeexplore

The Agent, a self-adaptive entity, which has the perception, adaption and reaction to the changes of the environment, operates in a dynamic environment. Consequently, a method to research the evolutionary optimization of SoS based on Agent model is proposed. Since each Agent is optimized autonomously, the Agents can adopt different optimization method according to their characteristics.

2012,An early look at defining variability requirements for system of systems platforms,"In the commercial domain, platform-based approaches, in which a set of functions or services are bundled to form the basis of many products, have enabled efficient development of systems and their composition into systems of systems. A successful platform must balance sufficient commonality to support economical reuse, while also providing variability and extensibility to enable innovation in system and system of systems (SoS) capabilities. These commonality/variability tradeoffs for SoS platforms are frequently tacit decisions, since there are no accepted techniques for analyzing such decisions at the scale and degree of requirements uncertainty that characterize most SoSs. The objective of our work is to develop a method for analyzing decisions about requirements for common platforms for SoSs. The method begins with the requirements tasks of identifying and selecting appropriate variabilities (variation points, variation ranges, and variation decision binding times) to support immediate SoS needs, and also enable innovation and controlled evolution. We are currently conducting a workshop and interviews with SoS experts to define the essential technical problems in SoS common platform development and identify solution constraints. We will then define a simplified SoS with limited capability requirements to use as a model problem. We will use the model problem to assess the fit of existing scope, commonality, and variability methods from software product lines to the SoS context, and extend existing economic models using real options and probabilistic models to model uncertainty in evolution requirements. While it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of our approach, it is based on proven technologies from the mature field of software product lines and so we have confidence that we can build successful SoS techniques from this foundation.",10.1109/RES4.2012.6347693,,ieeeexplore; scopus

Though complexity in the industry is recognized, research methodology has generally been reductionist, and has not understood tourism as a monolithic meta-system composed of independent and contributive component systems. Therefore, interpretations of tourism development are highly focused and sector-specific, thus limiting understanding of the complex inter-component relationships, the emergent behavior in system evolution and the impact of different component on the overall industrial capacity.

2021,How to Analyze the Safety of Concepts for a System-of-Systems?,"Developing safety-critical products like cars, trains, or airplanes requires rigor in following development processes, and evidence for product safety must be collected. Safety needs to be considered during each development step and traced through the development life cycle. The current standards and approaches focus on single human-operated products. The technical evolution enables integrating existing products and new autonomous products into system-of-systems to automate workflows and production streams. Developing safety-critical systems-of-systems requires similar processes and mapping to safety-related activities. However, it is unclear how to consider safety during different development steps for a safety-critical system-of-systems. The existing hazard analysis methods are not explicitly mapped to developing a system-of-systems and are vague about the required information on the intended behavior. This paper focuses on the concept phase for developing a system-of-systems, where different technical concepts for a specific product feature are evaluated. Specifically, we concentrate on the evaluation of the safety properties of each concept. We present a process to support the concept phase and apply a model-driven approach to capture the system-of-systems’ relevant information. We then show how this knowledge is used for conducting an FMEA and HAZOP analysis. Lastly, the results from the analysis are mapped back into the sequence diagrams. This information is made available during the next development stages. We apply the method during the concept phase for designing an industrial system-of-systems.

2016,Checking the architectural feasibility of Systems-of-Systems using formal descriptions,"Systems-of-Systems (SoSs) are evolutionary developed from independent systems to achieve missions through emergent behavior. As concrete systems which will actually participate in an SoS are, in general, not known at designtime, SoSs need to dynamically create coalitions among possible constituent systems at run-time. Due to these uncertainties, the SoS architecture needs to be described abstractly at designtime and then concretely constituted at run-time. An abstract SoS architecture description can thereby specify the correctness properties of coalitions that can be formed among constituent systems at run-time. In particular, it is important to ensure that concrete SoS architectures that may emerge at run-time from such coalitions correctly comply with the abstract SoS architecture description. To automatically check the feasibility of such concrete SoS architectures, in its initial form as well as further evolution, this paper presents an approach that formally expresses the abstract SoS architecture description and the rules governing the organization of SoSs in concrete architectures at run-time.

2018,Involving the Application Domain Expert in the Construction of Systems of Systems,"The system of systems (SoS) is a system whose definition is based on pre-existing independent systems in the runtime environment. The latter is in perpetual evolution thus forcing a recurrent adaptation of the SoS. Thus, during their life cycle the SoS are very exposed to the problem related to the evolution mentioned above. This problem is mainly due to a poor communication between the requirement definition stage and the design stage. In this paper we propose a method for addressing SE for SoS using the concepts Mission and Role. The first one allows the definition of the SoS's behavior, while the second allows to abstract this definition with respect to the constituent systems that may actually exist in the environment. This definition will be translated into an abstract architecture. The later will serve as a guide and controller of the choices proposed by the system architect during the design and evolution stages. With our approach we have correctly defined an SoS concerning crowd management during a sport event.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428728,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8428728/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2020,Towards a governance dashboard for smart cities initiatives: a system of systems approach,"This paper introduces a decision-making tool, designed to enable governing bodies to maintain management of traditional metropolitan areas as they evolve into smart cities. As metropolitan areas such as New York, Paris and Singapore begin embedding smart technologies into their infrastructure, real-time data become available to citizens and governments. As a result, new challenges have emerged that raised questions about more optimal ways to govern and manage cities operating as systems of systems environments that are now more highly connected and dynamic than ever before. To assist governing bodies to effectively manage these quickly growing systems of systems, this paper proposes a conceptual framework with a set of core building block components required to develop governance dashboards for smart cities. A case study of Singapore Smart City Lamppost initiative is presented, which acts as a practical example of the development of these governance dashboards within the lampposts component of smart cities and serves as a possible blueprint for expanding this approach to the rest of the smart city infrastructure.",10.1109/SoSE50414.2020.9130542,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2017,Cybersecurity challenges of systems-of-systems for fully-autonomous road vehicles,"We are seeing rapid development of in-vehicle, vehicleto- vehicle, intelligent roadway, infrastructure and ride-hailing systems. However, progress in some areas is much faster than in others. For example, in-vehicle self-driving systems are evolving rapidly, but development of intelligent road systems is relatively sluggish. These systems are beginning to interconnect and interoperate to become complex systems-of-systems for which attack surfaces and vulnerabilities are expanding exponentially. Many of these systems are standalone and proprietary and do not interoperate. However, systems must be seamlessly integrated if we are to arrive at safe and secure fully-autonomous road vehicles. If we do not create broad standards early on, we can expect vulnerabilities to grow so much that they could overwhelm potential benefits from improved safety and fuel economies. Warnings about cybersecurity consequences of such complexities appear from time to time in academic publications and the popular press, but few companies and government agencies do not seem to heed these admonitions and suggestions. Meanwhile, the self-driving juggernaut ploughs ahead. Here, we identify likely cybersecurity consequences that will arise because current efforts reflect uncoordinated design and development, particularly of supporting infrastructure systems. We describe how such risks might be mitigated proactively by introducing cybersecurity requirements early in the design, development and deployment processes. We also discuss how we might establish universal automotive and transportation security and safety standards that are enforceable and can be enforced globally across in-vehicle and ex-vehicle systems. While we see impressive near-term advances, particularly with in-vehicle systems and vehicle-to-vehicle systems, such innovations will eventually hit a roadblock if infrastructure systems, both physical and cyber, do not receive the attention required to achieve acceptable levels of cybersecurity and safety.",10.1109/CEWIT.2017.8263141,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,The Capability Concept in the Context of Systems of Systems: A Systematic Literature Review,"Systems of systems (SoS) leverage dynamic configuration of independent systems to achieve a capability neither of the independent constituent systems can achieve on their own. Therefore, SoS engineering goes beyond addressing requirements to addressing capabilities. Due to the independence of the constituent systems, capability is formed by complex interdependence of legacy systems. It is also subject to uncertainty of the evolutionary development of the SoS, making it important to not only see the bigger picture but to plan for the changing capability patterns in the life of an SoS. This study looks at the body of knowledge surrounding definitions, support systems and practices around the concept of capability in the context of SoS. The results show; context dependent nature of the definition of capability, country-specific support systems, ongoing efforts to form more robust frameworks and dominant establishment of this theme in the defense sector.",10.1109/ISSE54508.2022.10005489,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Nowadays a naval ship is being considered as part of larger systemsof-systems, and could even be possibly a kind of systemof-systems itself. Through interactions anticipation within others existing and future contributing systems, that will possibly include some sub-systems to be integrated on board, and more surely crews to operate them, the design of next generation surface and submarine combat ships has to cope with the systemsof-systems issues. The question to be raised is thereby: How methods and tools that support graphical user interface definition and development process are facing the systems-of-systems issues? This article aims to first list the existing and emerging solutions for Graphical User Interface design in the frame of combat ship: (i) from a crew-centered approach point of view, (ii) for specification and modelling, in the frame of system engineering; (iii) for specification, prototyping and (iv) for development and testing.

2013,System of systems engineering and geographical simulation: Towards a smart tourism industry information system,"The last few decades proves to be an era of booming communication and information disciplines, bringing about profound influence on people's life and every socio-economic sector. In this dramatically changed world, it is being found that many of the systems engineering principles and business practices that some industries have purposely pursued no longer function effectively in a System of Systems environment. This paper is inspired by the embedded, “system of systems (SoS) thinking” in the context of military programming. The purpose of this paper is to draw a conceptual framework for a smart tourism industry information system in responding to competitive challenges. The approach here is to illustrate how this SoS thinking and corresponding SoS engineering (SoSE) may be applied through the top-level design for the smart system. For designing a policy maker-responsive, informative system, an emerging complex spatial information approach, geographical simulation, is introduced. This holistic means includes: 1) simulation of the tourism SoS' architecture and evolution process through cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS) techniques, based on remote sensing data and GIS instrument; 2) illustration of the mechanism of industrial evolution by scale-free network analysis and social influence network with dynamic Bayesian network theory.

On the basis of analyzing the relationship between SoS capabilities and mission reliability, this work proposed a Markov chains model which can analyze SoS mission reliability quickly. We divide SoS states into three levels according to its capability level to complete assigned tasks, and SoS reliability under different tasks can be evaluated and analyzed by the corresponding state space transition expression. SoS reliability states are directly determined by its capabilities, and SoS capabilities are provided by groups of systems. So analyzing SoS reliability states should start from analyzing the states of constituent systems. A simplified case demonstrates how to apply the proposed method to evaluate the SoS mission reliability under continuous tasks.",10.1109/ICRSE.2015.7366452,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2014,Applying system of systems engineering to enable component-level modularity in communications systems,"Communications systems fielded by US-DoD and commercial organizations are often highly customized by individual programs and vendors. These systems are typically integrated into larger individual (system-of-systems) platforms one platform at a time. While such systems perform very well for their designed use, many do not consider enterprise requirements such as scalability, and aggregation of control and management in their design. Further, platform-by-platform customization of communications results in interoperability and interchangeability drift, where terminals cannot communicate with those from other generations, or cannot be swapped out at the component level. The end result is a set of system silos requiring completely separate and vendor-unique ancillary equipment and control infrastructure. Based on a survey of existing terminal management capabilities and trends in platform requirements, we developed a common, layered management interface structure for communications terminals, making them an interchangeable component of a system of systems (SoS). This interface allows an evolutionary path from the silo infrastructure to one that can aggregate control and management functions. By emphasizing control of interfaces between system elements and external systems, we mitigate risks to the SoS[1][2]. Additionally, working with terminal vendors and other stakeholders, we developed a management information base (MIB)[6] in accordance with this structure. Lastly, we developed a SNMP-based terminal controller connected into a service-oriented architecture (SOA) as a SOA service interface, and used this to test two vendors' SNMP agents implementing the MIB on their terminals. These tests validated the MIB and demonstrated its utility as a common control interface (CCI). Having validated the MIB, this test platform can be extended to validate subsequent implementations of both the SNMP agent and terminal controllers as units under test (UUT).",10.1109/SysCon.2014.6819251,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,"A System of Systems Framework for Intelligence in Autonomy, Big Data Analytic, and Applications : Plenary Talk","Large data has been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for quite some time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data”. System of Systems (SoS) are integration of independent operatable and non-homogeneous legacy systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today’s SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable “Big Data”. Recent efforts have developed promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses machine learning tools from statistical and soft computing (SC) such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Bayesian networks, deep architectures and deep learning, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to a) extract information, b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and c) eventually develop a nonparametric model for the “Big Data”. This keynote attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. A photovoltaic energy-forecasting problem of a micro grid SoS, traffic jams forecasting, brain disease prediction, and a system of autonomous vehicles will be offered for case studies.

2012,A simulation System of Systems to assess military aircraft protection,"A simulation-based System of Systems (SoS), called a Virtual Proving Ground (VPG), is being developed as a comprehensive and robust approach to support aircraft protection engineering and training. For more than 20 years, laboratories and specialized equipment were developed and operated for the evaluation of aircraft self-protection. Most of these systems were originally designed on a standalone basis to answer specific questions. On the other hand, operational requests followed an ad-hoc process that did not allow traceability and knowledge management. As these systems are complementary, their integration came as a logical path to increase the capability. This paper presents an overview of the VPG SoS, including the individual systems, the common architecture framework and the services that are key to a comprehensive approach: collaborative tools and computer-assisted processes. The paper also introduces the SoS inner capability to evolve and discusses the benefits of the approach. The VPG links hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) systems within a common virtual environment. The simulation includes not only services like time and error management, but also a robust execution engine that allows the execution of a broad variety of digital models. It was designed to facilitate reusability by flexible composition schemes and standardized interfaces. Like building blocks, the SoS allows the substitution of digital models with their HWIL counterparts. The decision to use a digital or hardware component must be based on the requirements for a specific level of fidelity or performance. The SoS extends beyond the sole integration of software and hardware systems. It also includes a set of collaborative tools with associated processes, and implements an overarching verification and validation methodology. The collaborative tools are developed to facilitate the communication and interaction, and bring a cultural change within the operational community. More than just a database or a portal, it unifies the way requests are managed by the stakeholders by clarifying the roles and responsibilities; it centralizes data from databases that were up to now located in different places; and finally, it greatly fosters knowledge management and robust problem solving within the organization.",10.1109/SysCon.2012.6189501,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2007,The Changing Role of the Systems Engineer in a System of Systems (SOS) Environment,"In traditional Systems Engineering, the Systems Engineer acts as the overall system creator. Primarily through stakeholder interaction, requirements analysis, and architectural design, the Systems Engineering shapes and influences the system solution through specifications, top-down design, and bottoms-up integration and test. With the large-scale introduction of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, the Systems Engineer acts more like a composer. The top-down requirements and design activities need to be adjusted to account for the bottoms-up constraints imposed by the COTS technology. The System Engineer shapes and influences COTS-based developments through requirements modifications and negotiations, along with simultaneous system design, integration, and test. This paper explores the changing role of the Systems Engineer in today's complex system of systems (SoS) environment. We will use the analogies of conductor and choreographer to describe the System Engineering leadership challenges that exist in a SoS environment. Similar to a conductor, we will look at the set of activities that ensure the elements in the SoS work together in harmony. Similar to a choreographer, we will look at the set of activities that ensure the expressive nature of each of the SoS elements is fully realized, while still conforming to its overall objectives. Using these analogies, we will draw some conclusions for the evolving Systems Engineering role in a SoS environment.

In SoS, a complex task is typically divided into sub-tasks that have a lower complexity and can be performed by multiple distributed systems working independently from each other. However, the coordination between these systems is of paramount importance to achieve the required compound complex task. Admission control and resource allocation are two essential mechanisms needed to coordinate the distributed tasks among the systems. However, performing admission control and resource allocation in such distributed systems is challenging, because of the distributed nature of SoS.

As the complexity and sociotechnical interactions of real systems increases, so too does our need to understand how to design and manage collaboration. The metric of collaboration efficiency (CE) is introduced as a measure of collaboration in any defined CSoS structure. To test the effect of constituent system parameters on CE, an agent-based model is developed that combines network evolution mechanisms (to model a system-of-systems) with evolutionary game theory (to model collaboration). Simulation results suggest that a reactive collaboration strategy or a reinforcement algorithm-based strategy converges to the highest CE in a CSoS, with 29.6% and 34.1%, respectively. The proposed approach and results allow conclusions about the best collaboration choices constituent systems should make when participating in CSoSs. Applicable to systems in energy, logistics, social organizations, infrastructure, and more, this research can improve the design and operation of systems in any CSoS.",10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812631,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2015,A Model-Based Approach for Requirements Engineering for Systems of Systems,"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a discipline of systems engineering in which the model forms the heart of all the systems engineering activities and is the basis of many of the project artefacts. Systems modeling is no longer viewed as simply a “good idea” but is becoming an increasingly important part of any systems engineering project. The application of MBSE is becoming well understood at the systems level; however, there is a lack of research and subsequent industrial application at the system of systems (SoS) level. This paper presents a model-based approach to requirements engineering for SoSs. The approach is derived from an MBSE approach to requirements engineering and therefore represents current best practice in SoSs in terms of established standards and research. This paper builds upon and is an evolution of the initial foundations for model-based requirements engineering for systems of systems that were published in an earlier paper.",10.1109/JSYST.2014.2312051,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6805167/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2021,Communication Oriented Modeling of Evolving Systems of Systems,"Systems of Systems (SoSs) are composed of systems characterized by operational and managerial independence, but that can perform tasks together that they could not do by themselves. Given their potential complexity, modeling and testing such systems can be a daunting task, which is repeated when any system is evolved into a new one, especially when SoSs pertain to different owners. We propose a framework for modeling SoSs using only observable communication properties and dataflow. In this paper, we propose a framework that supports SoS design and discuss how it can support the creation of complex use cases pertaining to multiple owners. We implemented a proof-of-concept for the framework that focuses on REST-based communication and combines design using the model-based engineering tool Papyrus, and verification of communication properties using the Uppaal model checker. We showcase our approach by designing a Bluetooth-driven tracker system, which uses smart devices' Bluetooth-IDs to analyze patterns in the stores that people visit.",10.1109/SOSE52739.2021.9497495,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

With the diversification of the exterior environments and required missions, the SoS is confronted with continuous capability requirements (CRs) evolution and the robust capstone planning of the SoS under the changing capability is of great significance. Based on the capability-based thought, an Multi-stage Robust Stochastic Programming Model for Complex SoS Portfolio Decision is built to address problems of Complex SoS capstone planning and construction with dynamic CRs.

However, due to their scale, structural and functional complexity and emergent properties, these global spanning Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems are becoming increasingly complex and more difficult for current requirements engineering (RE) practices to handle. In this paper, we firstly introduce SoSE as an emerging discipline and key characteristics of SoSs. We then highlight the challenges that the RE discipline must respond to. We discuss some weaknesses of current RE techniques and approaches to cope with the complexity of SoSs. We then argue that there is a need for the global RE community to evolve current RE approaches and to develop new ways of thinking, new RE capabilities and possibly a new RE science as a key mechanism for addressing requirements engineering complexities posed by Systems of Systems. We then outline a requirements engineering perspective and research agenda that identifies 'top-10' research themes informed by a cluster of four Systems of Systems Engineering projects funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 research programme.",10.1109/RE.2018.00021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8491128/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Medical information systems have embraced the advances in technology to provide better health care for the patients and significant workflow improvements for the hospitals. This has led to a noteworthy evolution of medical information systems over the last few decades. From what used to be single stand alone modalities, the evolution has passed through cluster of modalities; multi modality clusters in a single hospital and has now reached a stage where in we have an enterprise network connecting many such hospitals thereby creating a system of systems. Medical image repositories form a critical subsystem in the medical systems of systems. They have a diverse role to play in any hospital starting from storing of electronic patient records and scanned medical images generated by individual modalities like X-Ray and MR to storing of data in an enterprise hospital network.

Semi-autonomous Agents is applied to model the elements which are consists of SoSs. The framework of Parallel executive and feedback to real world is used to verify and validate the emergent properties which are useful to the SoSs or not.

2021,A Model-Based Approach to Document a System-of-Systems,"The technical evolution enables the development and application of autonomous systems in various domains. In the on-road and off-road vehicle domains, autonomous vehicles are applied in different contexts. Autonomous cars are designed as single system solutions, while in other scenarios, multiple autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles are integrated into a system-of-systems. We utilize a case from the earth-moving machinery domain, where a fleet of autonomous vehicles is used for transporting material in off-road environments. The traditional industrial development processes in the earth-moving machinery domain focus on single human-operated systems and lack clear support for autonomous system-of-systems. From our studies of industrial development of system-of-systems, we recognize the demand for guidance on how to document a system-of-systems. The goal of this work is to provide a framework using different model-based formalisms. As a structural background, we utilize the SafeSoS process, where each step specifies details about the targeted system-of-systems. Specifically, we apply model-based systems engineering to describe the structure and behavior of each SoS level. We utilize an industrial case to exemplify how model-based concepts can be applied to capture relevant information needed for designing the system-of-systems.

2017,Revisiting “The Meaning of Of” as a Theory for Collaborative System of Systems,"At the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems of Systems Engineering, Boardman and Sauser presented a set of characteristics based on an integrative review of the literature. These characteristics are the foundation of the Boardman-Sauser system of systems (SoS) theory. We accept this theory as the basis of collaborative SoS and desire a means to validate this assertion. While numerous simulations have been published, the target SoS is usually a specific implementation. These specialized simulations produce results applicable primarily to the system under study but not necessarily SoS in general. Simulating the mathematical model of the Boardman-Sauser SoS theory in the form of an agent-based model produces results that can be compared with chemical reactions. This paper contends that the formation of molecules from atoms is an analog of systems forming any collaborative SoS, which we call our molecule organization model. The result is a supported logical argument that validates the Boardman-Sauser SoS theory as definitive of a generic SoS with behavior applicable to collaborative SoS. This paper seeks to provide a unique contribution to the SoS body of knowledge by increasing our understanding of collaboration in an SoS, so we may better understand their health, maintenance, replication, and evolution.",10.1109/JSYST.2015.2430755,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7110531/,ieeeexplore; googlescholar
2021,Evolutionary Algorithm for Incremental Scheduling in Systems of Systems with Real-Time Requirements,"Time-triggered Systems-of-Systems (SoS) promise to satisfy the real-time and dependability requirements of safety-relevant applications such as medical systems, smart manufacturing and defense systems. However, the time-triggered scheduling algorithms in the state-of-the-art were developed for monolithic systems and they do not support the requirements and constraints of SoS. Scheduling tasks and optimizing the resource allocation in SoS is more complex than in monolithic systems due to the autonomy of its constituting systems, the lack of central control, and no global information about the resources in different constituent systems.In this article, we propose a two-level interactive heuristic approach using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to schedule real-time applications incrementally by adding them to the time-triggered SoS. We compute and deploy the schedule for each new SoS application at runtime after its arrival. Therefore, the limited communication and computational resources must be shared between different SoS applications released over time. By reducing the blocking time of shared resources, we can cope with the possible shortage of resources for future applications. Therefore, we develop a new resource allocation algorithm which creates more balance in the blocking times of shared resources and helps to satisfy future resource requests. We generate example scenarios to examine the schedulability of our new incremental scheduling algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed optimization scheme compared to an incremental scheduler without blocking time considerations can find a better schedule for a sequence of applications.",10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589124,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Establishing an engineering model for system of systems is essential for representing operational and managerial independence of component systems and their interactions leading to emergent and evolutionary development of system of systems with enhanced composite capabilities. This article contributes to system of systems modeling of physical component systems and organizational component systems. We propose a data-centric model for supervision of system of systems.

2015,Introducing Meta-Requirements for Describing System of Systems,"Complex, evolutionary systems operating in an open world can be seen as a composition of components which interact each other in order to fulfill their requirements. Following this vision, Systems of Systems (SoSs) literature aims at supporting the life of such complex systems taking into account key viewpoints such as emergence, time, mobility, evolution, dynamicity. Although different attempts can be found in the literature to address mostly specific viewpoints separately, it is still missing a unifying approach to analyze the whole set of viewpoints and their relationships, based on the identification of meta-requirements that can be exploited to describe any System of Systems (SoS). To this end, we developed a unifying meta-requirements model to describe SoSs viewpoints and relate them. The model is meant to be used to support the derivation of the requirements for any SoS. This paper introduces the problem, and presents the main notions of the meta-requirements model with the support of a domain-specific scenario.",10.1109/HASE.2015.31,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7027426/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2015,A knowledge-in-the-loop approach to integrated safety&security for cooperative system-of-systems,"A system-of-systems (SoS) is inherently open in configuration and evolutionary in lifecycle. For the next generation of cooperative cyber-physical system-of-systems, safety and security constitute two key issues of public concern that affect the deployment and acceptance. In engineering, the openness and evolutionary nature also entail radical paradigm shifts. This paper presents one novel approach to the development of qualified cyber-physical system-of-systems, with Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) as one target. The approach, referred to as knowledge-in-the-loop, aims to allow a synergy of well-managed lifecycles, formal quality assurance, and smart system features. One research goal is to enable an evolutionary development with continuous and traceable flows of system rationale from design-time to post-deployment time and back, supporting automated knowledge inference and enrichment. Another research goal is to develop a formal approach to risk-aware dynamic treatment of safety and security as a whole in the context of system-of-systems. Key base technologies include: (1) EAST-ADL for the consolidation of system-wide concerns and for the creation of an ontology for advanced run-time decisions, (2) Learning Based-Testing for run-time and post-deployment model inference, safety monitoring and testing, (3) Provable Isolation for run-time attack detection and enforcement of security in real-time operating systems.",10.1109/IntelCIS.2015.7397237,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7397237/,ieeeexplore; webofscience; googlescholar
2011,System of Systems and Emergence Part 1: Principles and Framework,"The paper is in two parts and in Part (1) attempts to formalise the loose concept of ""System of Systems"" (SoS) within the context of Systems Theory whilst in Part (2) explores and develops a conceptual framework for emergence that is suitable for further development. We view the notion of SoS as an evolution of the standard notion of systems and provide an abstract and generic definition that is detached from the particular domain. To achieve this we deal first with the abstraction of the fundamental components of the system, describe the different aspects of the structure of a composite system and then embark on the task to explain the difference of the new notion, to the standard notion of Composite Systems. We present a new abstract definition of the notion of System of Systems as an evolution of the notion of Composite Systems, empowered by the concept of autonomy and participation in tasks referred to as plays which are usually linked to games. The notion of the play is introduced as an extension of the notion of the system and involves the notion of autonomous agents in place of objects and the notion of scenario in place of interconnection topology. This new definition characterises SoS as a development of the Composite System notion where now the subsystems act as autonomous intelligent agents in a multi-agent system play based on a scenario that possibly involves a game. The notion of emergence is considered within both the framework of Composite and SoS and it is linked to the problem of defining functions on a given system and evaluating their values. The emergence is thus presented as the defining signature of a system including System of Systems.",10.1109/ICETET.2011.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6120549/,ieeeexplore; scopus; googlescholar
2022,Reinforcement Learning based System-of-Systems Approach for UAV Swarms Behavioral Evolution,"Advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies have enabled the development of biologically inspired swarms or fleets of UAVs that collaboratively achieve common mission objectives such as in surveillance and remote sensing applications. Typically, such swarms comprise of homogeneous UAVs that are developed using same techniques to serve the same purpose. However, the recent proliferation of UAV development by numerous research and commercial entities, using varied machine learning models to serve diverse purposes, has induced the need to rethink swarm development using heterogeneous UAVs that can adapt and achieve common objectives despite differences in their design and associated intelligence. In this paper, we present a novel approach to develop swarms of heterogeneous UAVs as System-of-Systems (SoS), and enabling behavioral evolution and adaptation of constituent UAVs through Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. The proposed approach involves SoS-Constituent System Measures Of Effectiveness Relationship (SSMR) model that correlates the Measures Of Effectiveness (MOEs) for the SoS with the MOEs of the constituent system UAVs. By formulating the SSMR as the reward mechanism of RL, our approach incorporates an Intelligent-Behavior Evolution Agent with the necessary constraints to learn to maximize the SoS and system-level MOEs, while adapting itself to the evolution in the swarm SoS. The initial experimental results indicate that our approach adequately trains these independent agents to be used in heterogeneous swarms.",10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773900,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Due to the varied methodologies and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering (SoSE). The purpose of this article is to provide a cursory description of the SoS basic concepts on the one hand, and then to analyse the main challenges in its development. Finally, we report the literature review showing various techniques and methods that have been modified from the conventional systems engineering to better fit the needs of SoSs design. We hope the findings of this work may encourage and inform the community researchers of the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these large-scale systems.

This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming model for CSAD problem-oriented mission planning and an improved evolutionary algorithm for solving the model. The goal of the CSAD problem is to design the architecture of the combat system-of-systems which is evaluated based on the performance of combat tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to model the mission planning problem, and the model should fit the characteristic of the combat system-of-systems architecture. An improved evolutionary algorithm to solve the mission planning problem is proposed. To improve the solution effect, the task planning algorithm based on predecessor strategy was designed. To further improve the performance of mission planning algorithm, an elite retention strategy was proposed, so that it can retain more good individuals and delete more poor individuals during the evolution of the algorithm, so that the solution process of the planning solution converges as soon as possible. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method can solve the CSAD problem well and has a significant improvement effect compared with the comparative neighborhood search algorithm and two heuristic algorithms.",10.1109/BigDIA56350.2022.9874048,,ieeeexplore; scopus

A system-of-systems conceptualization enables addressing emergent behavior, while letting the involved components and systems operate independently of each other. This property requires system interoperability and can be achieved by bigraph-based modeling. A flexible abstraction mechanism as well as a strong typing of system interaction enable system interoperability in evolutionary environments.

To better enable stakeholder integration, in recent past the concept of Domain Specific Systems Engineering (DSSE) has been proposed. This concept aims at establishing a modelling approach around domain specific viewpoints and model kinds. The DSSE approach could have been validated in different domains so far.

This paper will focus on identifying the differences, in both structure and behavior, between a system of components and a SoS. This will be demonstrated by relating the Advanced Hawkeye, which is currently being developed by Northrop Grumman, to the five differentiating characteristics of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, as defined by Boardman and Sauser in their paper entitled, ""system of systems - the meaning of of."" This paper will not classify the Advanced Hawkeye as being a system or a SoS, but will instead use these five characteristics to identify the advanced Hawkeye as existing someplace between the two extremes, as a complex system. The Advanced Hawkeye has been designed based on the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 configuration, and features upgrades to radar, communications, navigation and other aircraft systems, which will improve its supportability and readiness. The Advanced Hawkeye is a complex system, with multiple capabilities, making it a prime example to use for this project. Due to its complexity, and the classified nature of the aircraft, this paper will focus on a broad overview of the aircraft and its relationship to the five aforementioned differentiating characteristics.

Emergence is often the result of innovation within an SoS. We contend that, because of the complex adaptive nature of SoS, the assessment of the potential for innovation to create positive change is necessary for effective evolutionary planning. Innovation potential represents the convergence of three systems: the system of interest, the innovation system, and the context where these interact and come together. The three-system model is a useful perspective to assess the potential impact of innovation on the evolution of an SoS, and to describe the context of SoS emergence as enabled or constrained by its innovation system. We describe a set of methods and tools adapted from both SoS engineering and human-centered design which can be used for strategic design and planning of SoS evolution.

Current management practices are limited in their structural capacity for coping with such swift transformation, pointing to an urgent need for new approaches in management of complex engineered systems. The model-based approach has emerged as a new promising method to complexity management. However, it is still unclear what role simulation plays in this approach and whether the role differs based on the type of a system under consideration and/or the degree of complexity involved. In this paper, the authors conduct a comparative analysis between the disciplines of System Engineering (SE) and System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), and the significance of simulation in these areas. The paper concludes that simulation represents a major part of modeling of System of Systems (SoS), leading the authors to introduce a new term, Modeling and Simulation Based System of Systems Engineering (M&SBSoSE), to underline the importance of incorporating and integrating simulation into modeling applications in SoSE.

This is the level of system of systems. At this level similar standardized model- based approaches are used to capture knowledge; however, most analysis is far from being standards based. Most of the tools provide proprietary approaches to analyze a system of systems. Is there a way to apply a standards-based approach to execute engineering analysis and behavioral simulation on a system of systems model? This paper describes the research used to answer this question.",10.1109/SoSE50414.2020.9130510,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2023,Architecting System of Systems for Resilience using MBSE,"With rapid growth in the interconnectivity and interdependency among systems to deliver diverse set of capabilities, the challenge of architecting such System of Systems is becoming more complex, more so with the rapid evolution of technologies. To ease the involved complexity and challenges of System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), this paper summarizes the proposed approach and methodology for conducting architecture analysis of System of Systems (SoS) for resilience, and for assessing the SoS architectures qualitatively and quantitatively for the maturity level of resilience, using Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) as a support. The approach has been arrived at based on a taxonomy of principles that enable resilience in an architecture. Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) is used as a reference for defining the architecture principles, which can be utilized for defining the architecture in MBSE. The Search and Rescue sample model of SoS in UAF Plugin of Cameo Systems Modeler has been both augmented and assessed using the proposed methodology and architecture principles.",10.1109/SoSE59841.2023.10178534,,ieeeexplore; scopus

This paper investigates the nature of the constituent system capabilities beyond basic operational actions, to achieve a deeper understanding of what is required to participate in a system-of-systems. Through a case study of industrial ecosystems, the need is shown for planning how to use basic operational capabilities, for dynamic capabilities to achieve long-term evolution, and for resilience capabilities to deal with perturbations. This also affects the governance of the system. The findings are used to extend an existing conceptual model of constituent systems and to characterize collaboration in a system-of-systems that implements a value network.",10.1109/SoSE59841.2023.10178670,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10178670/,ieeeexplore; scopus; googlescholar
2011,Application of the generic modelling method for system of systems to manufacturing domain,"Meeting challenges of the competitive market, modern manufacturing systems are evolving to heterogeneous and distributed network of systems which can be seen as an application of systems of systems (SoS). There is a challenge to develop adequate modelling techniques and tools which would be able to capture paradoxical nature of SoS with its evolving boundaries and requirements, network centricity, heterogeneous composition, and distributed facilities in order to visualise, to design and to analyse modern manufacturing systems. The paper describes results of the first stage of an on-going research. The stage is dedicated to an application of the method based on modelling of SoS characteristics and interfaces between component systems to a conveyor-based pallet transferring system. With control of decentralization, each module of such a system can be seen as a subsystem for a SoS. The results of the application show that the method applied allows to provide description of the production system, and the model can automatically evolve with modifications in the system like for instance increase of the components. In the next stage of the research, the method will be applied to a more complex use case from the domain of composite materials manufacturing which can be considered as a SoS application, the development of a software environment for modelling and simulation is planned.",10.1109/IECON.2011.6119278,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6119278/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2021,A Hybrid between Model-Based Systems Engineering and Agile Methodologies for Simulation of Complex Weapon Systems of Systems,"Modern Aerospace and Defence capabilities are “Systems of Systems” (SoS) by design, which has resulted in the development of a range of new systems engineering techniques in order to address the challenges introduced by this complexity. The use of modelling and simulation for ongoing analysis forms the backbone of various SoS Engineering (SoSE) methodologies, and many of the challenges that arise in SoSE apply equally to the modelling, simulation and analysis of complex integrated systems. Weapons and Combat Systems Division, in collaboration with other Australian Department of Defence agencies, is developing a modelling, simulation and analysis capability in order to investigate the performance of integrated defence systems. The execution of this development is being undertaken in the form of a “study series” based on the SoSE Wave Model and is composed of discrete sub-studies. Each of these sub-studies is used to progressively increase the complexity of the scenario being modelled (both number of systems being modelled and model fidelity) whilst performing analysis and answering questions for Defence stakeholders. This approach ensures regular and ongoing feedback and investment from client groups, and that the final modelling and simulation capability is fit-for-purpose to meet the strategic objectives. The study series operates on a yearly cycle of analysis where traditional model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approaches are employed to support the analytical and top-level model requirements definition. However, the developers of the various software models used within the study series commonly apply Agile-based methodologies, in accordance with current software engineering best practice. A hybrid methodology has been developed to manage this, incorporating components of more traditional MBSE tools and techniques at the study level, and Agile methodologies for model development. This paper describes this hybrid methodology, including how MBSE is utilised to manage an evolving, complex, SoS simulation capability, define study requirements, and integrate with an Agile software model development approach. The paper employs an unclassified aerospace example in which modelling and simulation-based analyses have been applied to explore how different Uninhabited Aerial System concepts could be implemented in concert with other platforms to enhance an Anti-Ship Missile Defence capability. The requirements definition approaches are explored from both the analysts' and model developers' perspectives.",10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438152,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2016,A Holistic Viewpoint-Based SysML Profile to Design Systems-of-Systems,"In recent decades more and more efforts have been devoted in supporting the design of Systems-of-Systems (SoSs). These systems are composed of autonomous Constituent Systems (CSs) which are integrated together to achieve a higher level goal that cannot be achieved by any of its CSs in isolation. Designing such an SoS is a multidisciplinary problem which involves considering emergent phenomena, assuring the achievement of dependability and security requirements, guaranteeing system responsiveness, supporting dynamicity and evolution and multi-criticality of provided services. We believe that a first step towards a viable design approach is to provide a conceptual model of SoSs which captures SoS concepts (e.g., methods, characteristics, and technologies related to SoSs) and their inter-relationships. Such a conceptual model should enhance the understandability of SoSs to stakeholders and provide the basis for further automated analysis. In this context, the AMADEOS European project is bringing together researchers and practitioners to provide the support to design SoSs starting from the definition of a domain specific ontology serving as a vocabulary for SoSs. Our contribution consists of semi-formalizing the key SoS concepts and relationships defined in AMADEOS adopting a SysML visual modeling language. We propose a SysML profile for SoSs and we show its applicability in a Smart Grid scenario.",10.1109/HASE.2016.21,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7423166/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2019,Governing Regression Testing in Systems of Systems,"Great advances in network technology and software engineering have triggered the development and spread of Systems of Systems (SoSs). The dynamic and evolvable nature of SoSs poses important challenges on the validation of such systems and in particular on their regression testing, aiming at assessing that run-time changes and evolutions do not introduce regression in SoS behavior. This paper outlines issues and challenges of regression testing of SoSs, identifying the main kinds of evolution that can impact on their regression testing activity. Furthermore, it presents a conceptual framework for governing the regression testing of SoSs. The proposed framework leverages the concept of an orchestration graph that describes the flow of test cases and sketches a solution for deriving a regression test plan according to test cases dependencies.",10.1109/ISSREW.2019.00064,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2019,Architecting Systems-of-Systems for Operational Feedback: A Study of Army Infantry Training Analysis,"Army tactical units are best viewed as an acknowledged system of systems (SoS) that are in constant development and evolution. The constituent systems involve material, soldiers, and tactical procedures that combine to produce operational capability. Unfortunately, each of these types of systems follow a different development methodology and time-line and are rarely developed as a complete SoS. This paper identifies the challenges to the development of these SoS and the opportunities present within the current organizational context. Namely, this paper describes the necessity to reframe the idea of training as not only a developmental process, but as a formal part of the test and evaluation procedure within SoS development. We also present the results and insights gained from experiments aimed at gathering and fusing evaluation scores and performance metrics from two SoS training events. This effort demonstrates the inability to rely on human evaluators for precise or even consistent data collection on SoS and further illuminates the difficulty in obtaining objective measures of performance within the tactical environment. If SoS engineers and practitioners want to leverage the training paradigm for more formal test and evaluation feedback, significant efforts will be needed develop integrated and effective mechanisms of collection and analysis.",10.1109/SYSCON.2019.8836937,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

To verify the common goals in an SoS, one of the common approaches is a simulation-based verification. In this study, we develop the simulation-based verification and analysis for system of systems (SIMVA-SoS) tool. SIMVA-SoS consists of interactive simulation and statistical verification. The interactive simulation follows discrete-time and multi-agent simulation structures and enables continuous evolutionary representation. The statistical verification runs the simulation repeatedly and uses the simulation results to statistically determine the satisfaction of verification properties. In the case study, a stimulus was injected into the interactive simulator at runtime to examine the expressiveness of continuous evolution, and statistical verification results were analyzed. The SoS representation through interactive simulation and solving the state explosion problem through statistical verification confirmed the possibility of the simulationbased verification of the SoS.",10.1109/SoSE50414.2020.9130528,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2016,Formal methods for a system of systems analysis framework applied to traffic management,"Formal methods for systems and system of systems engineering (SoSE) can bring precision to architecting and design, and increased trustworthiness in verification; but they require the use of formal languages that are not broadly comprehensible to the various stakeholders. The evolution of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) lies in a middle ground between legacy document-based SoSE and formal methods. SysML is a graphical language but not a formal language. Initiatives in the Object Management Group (OMG), such as the development of the Foundational Unified Modeling Language (fUML) seek to bring precise semantics to object-oriented modeling languages. Following the philosophy of fUML, we offer a framework for associating precise semantics with Unified Modeling Language (UML) and SysML models essential for SoSE architecting and design. Straightforward methods are prescribed to develop the essential models and to create semantic transformations between them. Matrix representations can be used to perform analyses that are concordant with the system of UML or SysML models that represent the system or SoS. The framework and methods developed in this paper are applied to a Traffic Management system of systems (TMSoS) that has been a subject of research presented at previous IEEE SoSE conferences.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2016.7542918,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

This paper focuses on understanding the need for effort estimation for UASoS, the limitations of existing cost estimation models, and how our effort can be merged with the cost estimation processes. We present the prioritization of both technical and organizational cost drivers. We note that all drivers associated with time constraints, integration, complexity, understanding of architecture and requirements are rated highly, while those regarding stakeholders and team cohesion are rated as medium.

This paper describes strategies for value sustainment, using an application of the “wave model” to represent time-varying SoS Engineering (SoSE) activities and opportunities for SoS-change. A Maritime Security (MarSec) SoS case study is described, and simulation-based Era Analysis is used to evaluate SoS alternatives through different operational environments for an assumed 8-year time frame. Eight SoS designs are evaluated and compared across four strategies in terms of accumulated utility, discounted cost, and total down time. The four value sustainment strategies are: (1) self-recovery, the SoS is not changed (i.e., relating to survivability/robustness); (2) changes in the design of the SoS are allowed (i.e., relating to changeability); (3) changes in the architecture of the SoS are allowed (i.e., relating to evolvability) once, or (4) three times in the eight years. The results provide an example of how quantitative approaches can be used to gain insights into tradeoffs in how SoS architects can create value-sustainable SoSs for the long run.",10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549963,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6549963/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

For example, military commanders recognize that in order to confront threats from high-tech adversaries, an advanced system of systems (SoS) is required to coordinate combat across multiple battlefield domains: land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), along with associated Modeling and Simulation (M&S) tools, can fill some of this need, especially for operational decision-support for complex multi-domain environments. This paper presents an M&S-based SoSE approach for complex SoS composed of deterministic and non-deterministic subsystems supported with reinforcement learning.

2018,Design of an Optimized Architecture for Manned and Unmanned Combat System-of-Systems: Formulation and Coevolutionary Optimization,"With the rapid advancement of unmanned combat systems and the maturation of unmanned swarm technology, integrating unmanned combat systems into existing combat system of systems has become a hot topic. However, the current research at the organizational level is basically nonexistent. Therefore, we propose a methodology for designing an optimized architecture that is a significant product at this level to fill this technical gap. The design process consists of two steps: architecture modeling and coevolutionary optimization. The architecture model is composed of three basic elements, which are mission, equipment, and the command and control structure. The selection of the best scheme from possible solutions is a multiobjective optimization problem, and its computational complexity increases rapidly with the increase in the scale of combat system of systems. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm NSGA-III and improve it by using preference vectors to enhance the algorithm's local search capability. Finally, we conduct the comparative experiments on benchmark test suites and design an operation case to demonstrate the advance and effectiveness of the enhanced algorithm. The proposed architecture modeling and optimization method can achieve a set of nondominated solutions and provide auxiliary decision-making information to help commanders make decisions and arrangements.",10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870969,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2023,Complexity in the delivery of product passports: a system of systems approach to passport lifecycles,"Product passports are an emerging data innovation positioned as an information tool to enable sustainable and circular futures, where such futures are delivered through increased and more precise information about resources, products, and processes across the “product lifecycle”. But this is a complex problem space where traditional linear product lifecycles do not reflect the nature and lifespan of articulated passport information types. This is because passports are not records of products per se (as the name would suggest) but descriptions of the lifecycle activities associated with those individual product assets, collating data points throughout engineering, use, re-use, and end-of-life processes. Unfortunately, this distinction is often overlooked, given the limited attention to the life of a product passport after manufacture and the differences between product passports and product passport systems. This paper presents a generic ‘lifecycle model for a passport’ as an information system of systems comprised of nine constituent lifecycle viewpoints. It builds upon recent research developing the idea of a digital product passport ‘ecosystem’, focusing on the specific application of the battery passport. Each lifecycle viewpoint is framed as a distinct ‘information system of systems' within a broader information ecosystem. Established concepts within the systems discipline are used to show inherent differences in each viewpoint's spatial and temporal focus and explain the relationships between each lifecycle viewpoint, thus articulating the parent-child relationships of different datasets and the necessary interoperability between information domains and engineering activities. The resultant model highlights the likely evolution of data requirements over an individual passport's lifespan, thus contributing to a possible future vision for an interoperable battery passport ecosystem. Furthermore, it is suggested that this lifecycle model can inform the evaluation and discussion of “completeness” for any passport-type system, given its adoption of interdisciplinary systems domain techniques and concepts, helping shape future exploration of the circular economy capability space.",10.1109/SoSE59841.2023.10178575,,ieeeexplore; scopus

There is a need to better understand the enterprise nature of the domains (e.g. defence, utilities, and transport) to enable human participants in such systems to cope more effectively with the increase in complexity that SoS imply.

The most fundamental of enterprise purposes are manifest in enterprise operations, in which the enterprise interacts with the larger world external to itself, and this aspect of enterprise dynamics is modeled. SoSE is but one aspect of an enterprise's activities, and the whole set of enterprise activities is predominantly oriented towards accomplishing and supporting the enterprise's mission in operations.

This paper introduces a conceptual model and a scheduling algorithm for supporting real-time requirements in SoS. Real-time support is essential in many safety-relevant application areas such medical, military and industrial SoS. The search for a feasible schedule is computed incrementally upon the introduction of new applications in the SoS. The distributed computation of the schedule using the different constituent systems considers the lack of global knowledge and control in the SoS, while also reducing the overall scheduling time. Concurrent scheduling activities are supported to deal with the uncoordinated and possibly simultaneous introduction of multiple applications. The paper introduces a high-level scheduling algorithm for the SoS as well as a low-level scheduling problem for individual constituent systems. The incremental scheduling problem for the constituent systems is formulated using IBM CPLEX.

Over the past ten years fast technological and industrial advances in the domain of autonomous and cooperating systems started to occur, which created new opportunities to use the benefits of SoS. In the near future, fully autonomous and cooperating systems are expected to become our reality and increase the production efficiency, while decreasing the human effort in harmful environments. There exist the need to make sure that critical properties of SoS, such as safety and security are guaranteed as a joint effort, since it is not sufficient anymore to address these properties independently in the development process.

2010,Systems-of-Systems Analysis of Ballistic Missile Defense Architecture Effectiveness Through Surrogate Modeling and Simulation,"Traditionally, the analysis of Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) effectiveness has been limited in fidelity due to the inherent complexity of the subject. Indeed, the BMDS battle management process involves monitoring and controlling the actions of many interacting participants (e.g. radar sensors, communications networks and interceptor missiles) in a process whereby a target moves from launch through sensor detection through intercept kill assessment. Because the actions of each participant may evolve independently, the battle management process functions as a true system-of-systems (SoS). Proper SoS analysis requires architecture level engineering, dealing with component functional allocation and inter-component interaction rather than the internal workings of individual participants. Although prior work has been identified that addresses BMD effectiveness at the SoS level, each method sacrifices analysis fidelity of both process elements and individual participants to enable timely decision making. This paper proposes a modeling and simulation (M&S) framework that supports architecture level analysis of the BMDS. The key innovation is the application of neural network surrogate models, which are representations of other high- or medium-fidelity M&S tools, and can be executed rapidly with negligible loss in fidelity. Surrogate models were created of a BMDS analysis tool that included multisensor target tracking and fusion codes. Results will show the benefit of integrating M&S to architecture level analysis. Specific examples include sensitivity of operational level metrics to formation of an integration tracking picture, and the enabling architecture level decision making.",10.1109/JSYST.2010.2045541,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5451061/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

In particular, we highlight the specific difficulties regarding acceptance and testing. A first group of testing challenges is raised by the need of accepting the integration of such large systems, and the ability to reconfigure them at runtime. A second group of testing challenges comes from the fact that, generally, not all the sub-systems are designed along the same kind of architecture (e.g. client-server vs. publish-subscribe architecture).

One of the major priorities when designing SoS, is to analyze the unknown dependencies among CS services and vulnerabilities leading to potential cyberattacks. The aim of this work is to investigate how Software Engineering approaches could be leveraged to analyze the cyberattack propagation problem within an SoS. Such analysis is essential for an efficient SoS risk assessment performed early at the SoS design phase and required to protect the SoS from possibly high impact attacks affecting its safety and security. In order to achieve our objective, we present a model-driven analysis approach, based on Bayesian Networks, a sensitivity analysis and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) with aim to discover potential cyberattacks propagation and estimate the probability of a security failure and its impact on SoS services. We illustrate this approach in an autonomous quarry example.",10.1109/APSEC48747.2019.00056,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2016,Interface design in cyber-physical Systems-of-Systems,"A Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems (CPSoS) is a possibly huge information processing and energy transforming system. Its autonomous Constituent Systems (CSs), i.e., computer systems, and optionally physical systems and humans, interact in their common environment to realize often mutually beneficial emergent CPSoS services. Many key challenges in understanding, designing, and engineering such CPSoSs are related to the interactions of CSs. This paper conceptualizes these interactions of CSs, i.e., their interfaces, at three abstraction levels: cyberphysical, Itom, and service. The cyber-physical level concernes message-based interactions in cyber space, and stigmergic interactions in the physical environment. The Itom level involves the description of direct and indirect information transfers. The service level helps to tackle challenges related to the dynamicity and evolution of CPSoSs. The second part of the paper discusses design aspects of Relied Upon Interfaces (RUIs) which are the interfaces the overall emergent CPSoS service relies upon. The conceptualization of interfaces in CPSoSs and the proposed RUI design aspects are intended to simplify the modeling of CPSoSs and to facilitate their deployment with existing Internet-of-Things and cloud technologies.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2016.7542924,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2017,Multilevel Agent-Based Modeling of System of Systems,"This paper deals with the generic modeling of systems of systems (SoSs) using agent-based modeling. SoSs are large-scale systems, including numerous-possibly heterogeneous-interacting component systems evolving in a dynamic environment. The aim of this paper is to provide generic formalism allowing to represent and control the whole complexity of a SoS using agent-based simulations. In particular, organizational aspects of SoSs are managed with the Agent-Group-Role model. Functional aspects, guiding SoSs to accomplish their global goals, are handled via a functional specification. Multilevel aspects are modeled with the Influence Reaction Model for Multilevel Simulation (IRM4MLS) agent-based meta-model. Models generated using this formalism encompass static and dynamic aspects of SoSs. They consider reorganization of SoSs caused by changes of goals or subsystem capacity. All these elements are illustrated in this paper using a SoS case study of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles initiated by the Intelligent Transportation for Dynamic Environment (InTraDE) European project to automate the port container logistic.",10.1109/JSYST.2015.2429679,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7158990/,ieeeexplore; webofscience; googlescholar
2022,Holistic Assurance Case for System-of-Systems,"Aviation is a highly sophisticated and complex System-of-Systems (SoSs) with equally complex safety oversight. As novel products with autonomous functions and interactions between component systems are adopted, the number of interdependencies within and among the SoS grows. These interactions may not always be obvious. Understanding how proposed products (component systems) fit into the context of a larger SoS is essential to promote the safe use of new as well as conventional technology.UL 4600, is a Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products specifically written for completely autonomous Load vehicles. The goal-based, technology-neutral features of this standard make it adaptable to other industries and applications.This paper, using the philosophy of UL 4600, gives guidance for creating an assurance case for products in an SoS context. An assurance argument is a cogent structured argument concluding that an autonomous aircraft system possesses all applicable through-life performance and safety properties. The assurance case process can be repeated at each level in the SoS: aircraft, aircraft system, unmodified components, and modified components. The original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) develops the assurance case for the whole aircraft envisioned in the type certification process. Assurance cases are continuously validated by collecting and analyzing Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs). SPIs provide predictive safety information, thus offering an opportunity to improve safety by preventing incidents and accidents. Continuous validation is essential for risk-based approval of autonomously evolving (dynamic) systems, learning systems, and new technology. System variants, derivatives, and components are captured in a subordinate assurance case by their developer. These variants of the assurance case inherently reflect the evolution of the vehicle-level derivatives and options in the context of their specific target ecosystem. These subordinate assurance cases are nested under the argument put forward by the OEM of components and aircraft, for certification credit.It has become a common practice in aviation to address design hazards through operational mitigations. It is also common for hazards noted in an aircraft component system to be mitigated within another component system. Where a component system depends on risk mitigation in another component of the SoS, organizational responsibilities must be stated explicitly in the assurance case. However, current practices do not formalize accounting for these dependencies by the parties responsible for design; consequently, subsequent modifications are made without the benefit of critical safety-related information from the OEMs. The resulting assurance cases, including 3rd party vehicle modifications, must be scrutinized as part of the holistic validation process.When changes are made to a product represented within the assurance case, their impact must be analyzed and reflected in an updated assurance case. An OEM can facilitate this by integrating affected assurance cases across their customer’s supply chains to ensure their validity. The OEM is expected to exercise the sphere-of-control over their product even if it includes outsourced components. Any organization that modifies a product (with or without assurance argumentation information from other suppliers) is accountable for validating the conditions for any dependent mitigations. For example, the OEM may manage the assurance argumentation by identifying requirements and supporting SPI that must be applied in all component assurance cases. For their part, component assurance cases must accommodate all spheres-of-control that mitigate the risks they present in their respective contexts. The assurance case must express how interdependent mitigations will collectively assure the outcome. These considerations are much more than interface requirements and include explicit hazard mitigation dependencies between SoS components. A properly integrated SoS assurance case reflects a set of interdependent systems that could be independently developed..Even in this extremely interconnected environment, stakeholders must make accommodations for the independent evolution of products in a manner that protects proprietary information, domain knowledge, and safety data. The collective safety outcome for the SoS is based on the interdependence of mitigations by each constituent component and could not be accomplished by any single component. This dependency must be explicit in the assurance case and should include operational mitigations predicated on people and processes.Assurance cases could be used to gain regulatory approval of conventional and new technology. They can also serve to demonstrate consistency with a desired level of safety, especially in SoSs whose existing standards may not be adequate. This paper also provides guidelines for preserving alignment between component assurance cases along a product supply chain, and the respective SoSs that they support. It shows how assurance is a continuous process that spans product evolution through the monitoring of interdependent requirements and SPI. The interdependency necessary for a successful assurance case encourages stakeholders to identify and formally accept critical interconnections between related organizations. The resulting coordination promotes accountability for safety through increased awareness and the cultivation of a positive safety culture.",10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925789,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2011,Modeling system of systems: A generic method based on system characteristics and interface,"In the 90s there was introduced concept of system of systems (SoS) in order to deal with growing complexity, geographical distribution, and heterogeneity of the various technological systems such as, for instance, modern factories. Methods of the traditional system engineering have been challenged in capturing of SoS specific nature like evolving requirements, ambulatory boundaries, decentralization, and other. In order to analyze, simulate and modify such kind of systems, there should be developed modeling methods and tools which would be capable to encompass the SoS specific properties. The aim of this work was to propose a computational method to model SoS, which could be further applied to the description and simulation of the highly distributed, heterogeneous, and networked production systems of the future. It was concluded that the proposed approach is able to provide the static and dynamic descriptions of the SoS-components and the communication between them in detailed yet relatively simple mode. For further maturing of the approach and with order to prove the applicability of the method proposed, next steps will be implemented: the method will be tested on a tesbed of a production line, and then a modeling of a real use case from the domain of manufacturing is preplanned.",10.1109/INDIN.2011.6034903,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6034903/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Following the principles of event-driven and service-oriented architectures, the system is able to provide novel yet coherent behaviour and features based on a dynamic self-organization. The process of self-organization is established on the basis of autonomous and concurrent tasks that are enacted by choreographies specifying the expected behaviour of the participating components. Although the individual systems are able to act completely independently, their interactions expose emergent structures of evolving nature in a process of re-organizing their network. By the specification of global conversations, maintained in commonly available semantic registries it is possible to establish a federation of systems that is able to adapt its behaviour to unforeseen events like partly system failures.",10.1109/ISADS.2013.6513440,,ieeeexplore

We seek a science and approach that we believe will provide richer insight into SoS failure, “health” maintenance, repair, replication, growth, and mutation-all those features of the evolution of systems which constantly challenge us and which, thus far, we have only been able to explain via macrolevel models and tools. We propose to go deeper into the structure of these systems and to discover their “DNA” (building blocks), thus establishing a foundation to understand their behavior using biological analogies, which we believe will turn out to be more than metaphors.

2005,System software framework for system of systems avionics,"Project Constellation implements NASA's vision for space exploration to expand human presence in our solar system. The engineering focus of this project is developing a system of systems architecture. This architecture allows for the incremental development of the overall program. Systems can be built and connected in a ""Lego style"" manner to generate configurations supporting various mission objectives. The development of the avionics or control systems of such a massive project will result in concurrent engineering. Also, each system will have software and the need to communicate with other (possibly heterogeneous) systems. Fortunately, this design problem has already been solved during the creation and evolution of systems such as the Internet and the Department of Defense's successful effort to standardize distributed simulation (now IEEE 1516). The solution relies on the use of a standard layered software framework and a communication protocol. A standard framework and communication protocol is suggested for the development and maintenance of Project Constellation systems. The ARINC 653 standard is a great start for such a common software framework. This paper proposes a common system software framework that uses the Real Time Publish/Subscribe protocol for framework-to-framework communication to extend ARINC 653. It is highly recommended that such a framework be established before development. This is important for the success of concurrent engineering. The framework provides an infrastructure for general system services and is designed for flexibility to support a spiral development effort.",10.1109/DASC.2005.1563458,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2021,Interdependency Incorporated Combat System-of-Systems Architecture Selection Towards Capability Optimization,"Architecture design that lays out the structure of components and their relationships plays a critical role in the combat system-of-systems (SoS) development. When the number of systems and their interactions keeps increasing in the future mosaic warfare oriented combat SoS, optimal architecture selection becomes very important due to the large number of possible design alternatives. However, in the optimal architecture selection problems, the dependency relationship between component systems has not been well captured. Thus, this paper developed a functional dependency incorporated architecture optimization formulation through a non-linear capability aggregation model. The architectural decisions include the allocation of physical systems to given functions and the determination of dependency parameters. Differential evolution algorithm is employed to solve this non-linear optimization problem. An application to a synthetic naval air and missile defense example in the end demonstrates that the proposed method can pick out the optimized architecture decisions for the combat SoS development.",10.1109/SMC52423.2021.9659166,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,"System-of-Systems Architecture Selection: A Survey of Issues, Methods, and Opportunities","System-of-systems (SoSs) architecture concerns the structure of components, their relationships, and their principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time. Well-designed architecture is key to manage the SoS complexity, and thus plays a considerable role in the SoS development and evolution. Architecture selection that aims to identify the desired architectures from a large alternative design space is an initial but critical step toward successful architecture design. Decision-makers need scientific methods to identify those better, more informed but perhaps unexpected architecture solutions. However, the unique SoS characteristics such as interdependency and autonomy bring significant challenges to the architecture selection studies. This article identifies seven critical perspectives in SoS architecture selection, including the conceptual framework, evaluation criteria, interdependency, uncertainty, autonomy, dynamic evolution, and computational methods. The available methods, tools, and processes in the SoS and associated domains are reviewed thoroughly regarding each perspective. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the current research status of SoS architecture selection. It builds a holistic picture that brings the fragmented pieces of the puzzle together.

2022,Stakeholder Management in Digital Transformation: A System of Systems Approach,"Major technological advances, globalization, geopolitical instability changes, and recent COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted organisations’ increased reliance on rapidly evolving technology to maintain operations and deliver products and services as seamlessly as possible. Consequently, digital transformation has emerged as a key priority for organisations to effectively adopt rapidly evolving technology. Digital transformation requires many stakeholders working together to achieve a common objective of supporting the organisation through a fundamental change. Managing the stakeholders is then a critical challenge in the process. Stakeholders often have different viewpoints, which can be a potent opportunity for tapping into their shared collective intelligence to develop new ideas and solutions. However, successfully incorporating these diverse perspectives and also preserving emergent behaviour is a demanding task since no methodology currently exists to support such integration. This paper proposes a System of Systems approach to stakeholder management in digital transformation, where each stakeholder is recognized as an individual, autonomous, decentralized, and heterogeneous system with its own set of attributes while simultaneously being part of a larger collective whole, or SoS. By considering each stakeholder as a system within a greater SoS, emergent behaviour that is created through stakeholder interaction can be fostered and reinforced. Since the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, emergence generated as part of a collective interface of relevant stakeholders enables more holistic stakeholder integration and contributes to more effective governance.",10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812667,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2021,Challenges in providing sustainable analytic of system of systems with long life time,"Embedded systems are today often self-sufficient systems with limited communication. However, this traditional view of an embedded system is changing rapidly. Embedded systems are nowadays evolving, e.g., an evolution pushed by the increased functional gain introduced with the concept of System of Systems (SoS) that is connecting multiple subsystems to achieve a combined functionality and/or information of a higher value. In such a SoS the subsystems will have to serve a dual purpose in a) the initial purpose that the subsystem was originally designed and deployed for, e.g., control and protection of the physical assets of a critical infrastructure system that could be up and running for 30-40 years, and b) at the same time provide information to a higher-level system for a potential future increase of system functionality as technology matures and/or new opportunities are provided by, e.g., greater analytics capabilities. In this paper, within the context of a “dual purpose use” of a) and b), we bring up three central challenges related to i) information gathering, ii) life-cycle management, and iii) data governance, and we propose directions for solutions to these challenges that need to be evaluated already at design time.",10.1109/SOSE52739.2021.9497465,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Then, the multi-attribute utility theory, experimental design method, response surface modeling technology and differential evolution algorithm are combined to find a satisfactory global optimal solution with the least information exchange and iterative process.

Results from model runs show that an evaluation of the overall SoS goal emerges organically from the transfer of drag reduction benefits among flock members; that benefits accrue to each individual member system as well as to the collective; and that the degree to which belonging benefits the whole varies depending on initial choices made regarding the architecture of the SoS.

2023,Technology Prioritization and Architecture Flexibility for Space System-of-Systems,"Decision makers face a difficult task when planning large-scale space missions or long-term development of technologies for space systems architectures. The difficulties arise from multiple factors. First, the size of the problem, the diversity of the involved systems and technologies, and the variety of stakeholders and their needs result in a large a complex trade space. Second, technologies are continuously evolving, and it can be hard to find data and model for new technologies, which increases the uncertainty about availability and performance. Third, in these complex problems decision makers need to account not only for traditional engineering trade-off (including cost, time, performance, and risk) but also for policies, stakeholder preferences, and flexibility of space architectures. Building on our previous research in System-of-Systems methodologies, we propose a combination of tools to support decision-making for technology prioritization and analysis of development time, risk, and flexibility of space architectures. Based on developmental dependencies between technologies, Technology Readiness Level (TRL), mission requirements, uncertainty, cost, and budget limitations, the tools produce the optimal expected schedule and allow the user to identify potential bottleneck and risks. Different strategies for prioritization of technologies can also be compared. The tools can handle constraints such as policies or stakeholder preferences, which impose prioritization of certain technologies or space missions. Finally, since long-term space mission planning is very dynamic and its specific objectives change often, we implemented tools to add analysis of flexibility on top of the technology prioritization tools. This analysis is performed from different perspectives. From a mission viewpoint, given a selected mission category (and its associated technologies), we assess how difficult it is to transition to a different mission, in terms of cost and number of technologies that are missing, as well as evaluating differences in cost. From a programmatic viewpoint, we quantify flexibility of specific technology prioritization schedules when decisions to switch to a different mission arise.",10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115852,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

As a first main consequence, the industrial automation landscape is also increasing in complexity, presenting new challenges for engineers and practitioners. Examples include dealing with evolvable heterogeneous structures that do not appear fully formed and where functions and purposes are added, removed or modified along the life cycle; as well as managing emergent properties and behaviours of entire systems, e.g. resulting from integrating new systems being not localized to any single system component. Although the component systems keep their operational and managerial independence, when they are interconnected and integrated, collaboration, cooperation and competition relationships, appear all along three major collaboration axes (lifecycle, value chain and enterprise), which should be understood, controlled and managed. In this work an effort to examine those systems under the prism of System of Systems approach, and address first recommendations to determine architectures, evolutionary steps, benefits, roadblocks as well as migration approaches that need to be followed is presented.",10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505980,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6505980/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2017,Architecturally describing the emergent behavior of software-intensive system-of-systems with SosADL,"A System-of-Systems (SoS) is evolutionary developed from independent systems to achieve missions not possible to be accomplished by a single system alone. They are architecturally designed to exhibit emergent behavior, i.e. a new behavior that stem from the interactions among constituent systems, but cannot be deduced from the behaviors of the constituent systems themselves. This paper presents the concepts and constructs of a novel Architecture Description Language (ADL), named SosADL, for architecturally describing emergent behaviors of software-intensive SoSs. It refines the notion of emergent behavior and details how SosADL enables the architectural description of emergent behaviors. In particular, it demonstrates SosADL features for emergent behavior through an excerpt of a real application for architecting a Reconnaissance SoS, focusing on the flocking behavior of a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).",10.1109/SYSOSE.2017.7994941,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7994941/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

However, none of these ADLs has the expressive power for formally describing the evolutionary architecture of a System-of-Systems (SoS). Recently, a novel ADL, called SosADL, was specially conceived for formally describing the software architecture of SoSs.

In this framework, we propose a concept of system of systems (SoS), allowing reconstructing communication of IAV without navigation from a cooperation between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to Intelligent Autonomous Vehicle (IAV-UAV). Thus, a model-based cooperative (SoS) is developed from theory and practice, demonstrating the five properties of: managerial independency, operational independency, cooperative behaviour, geographical dispersion and evolutionary development.

2018,A multi-objective optimization approach for analysing and architecting system of systems,"Electromobility is often associated with a limitation of the usual mobility. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) try to reduce the drawbacks and to generate an added value by networking Electric Vehicles (EV) with other electric power systems. This corresponds to the concept of System of Systems (SoS). The characteristics of these are distinguished with the autonomy of the constituent systems, an evolutionary development and an emergent behavior of the SOS. Due to a high number of variants of constituent systems with different technical properties, the architecture process is a combinatorial optimization problem. Since traditional architecting methods are focused on stand-alone systems, they are not appropriate for developing those combinatorial SoS architectures. As a result, there is a need for a better architecting methodology, which reflects the SoS specific characteristics within the developing process. This paper presents a new methodology for searching, assessing and optimizing SoS architectures based on a genetic algorithm. The new methodology has been applied to a scenario of an energetic EV integration into a smart home environment.",10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369581,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

The extension of SOA to include the concept of process orientation could be the next evolutionary step for SOA. Before starting to define reference architectures for process-oriented SOA in SoS it would be advantageous to learn more about the current state of process handling in a SoS. The objective of the current paper is to describe the different approaches to implementing processes in a SoS. The term processing chain is introduced as an abstract representation of processes in SoS. A classification of processing chains is defined and an approximate distribution of different ""processing chains"" is presented in a case study based on the analyzed SoS.

2008,System-of-Systems Engineering Management: A Review of Modern History and a Path Forward,"As our knowledge of system of systems (SoS) has grown and evolved, so has our understanding of how to engineer and manage them. In systems engineering, we develop architectures and frameworks to bring meaning to this kind of uncertainty, but for SoS engineering (SoSE) we are still in search of how we can structure this understanding. In this paper, we review the SoS literature to illustrate the need to create an SoSE management framework based on the demands of constant technological progress in a complex dynamic environment. We conclude from this review that the history and evolution of defining SoS has shown that: (1) SoS can be defined by distinguishing characteristics and (2) SoS can be viewed as a network where the ldquobest practicesrdquo of network management can be applied to SoSE. We use these two theories as a foundation for our objective to create an effective SoSE management framework. To accomplish this, we utilize modified fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) network principles (SoSE management conceptual areas). Furthermore, cited distinguishing characteristics of SoS are also used to present a SoSE management framework. We conclude with a case analysis of this framework using a known and well-documented SoS (i.e., Integrated Deepwater System) to illustrate how to better understand, engineer, and manage within the domain of SoSE.",10.1109/JSYST.2008.2007163,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4682611/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2021,Symbiotic System of Systems Design for Safe and Resilient Autonomous Robotics in Offshore Wind Farms,"To reduce Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenditure on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the cost relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to advances in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) for solutions. Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3117727,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9558777/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

This representation of the system provides a framework to test a large number of hypotheses about the evolution of the system's performance using computational experiments. In particular, in a situation where the realized emission level misses the intermediate target, policies can be adapted to meet the policy target.

2014,A Flexible Framework for Runtime Monitoring of System-of-Systems Architectures,"Many software systems today have system-of systems (SoS) architectures comprising interrelated and heterogeneous systems, which are developed by multiple teams and companies. Such systems emerge gradually and it is hard to analyze or predict their behavior due to their scale and complexity. In particular, certain behavior only emerges at runtime due to complex interactions between the involved systems and their environment. Monitoring the behavior of SoS at runtime is thus essential during development and evolution. However, existing monitoring approaches are often limited to particular architectural styles or technologies and are thus hard to apply in SoS architectures. In this paper we first analyze the challenges for monitoring SoS based on an industrial SoS for the automation of metallurgical plants. We then propose a flexible framework for monitoring heterogeneous systems within a SoS. We demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to two systems of an industrial SoS. We also report results of an evaluation assessing the framework's performance and scalability.",10.1109/WICSA.2014.12,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6827101/,ieeeexplore; scopus; googlescholar

Cost evolution curves for individual systems as well for whole FTTH WDM and TDM networks are presented. The analysis can be exploited for a fast and accurate analysis of FTTH deployment costs in dense urban, urban, and suburban areas from the technoeconomic point of view, which is of paramount importance for telecom operators, equipment vendors, regulators, and policy makers. The impact of delaying the deployments or adopting different rollout strategies is also investigated and presented. The SoS emergent behavior is further revealed using exploratory modeling. The results reveal that in all cases, the WDM solution is more expensive than TDM. The total cost for suburban areas is almost six times higher than in dense urban areas and four times than urban areas.",10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2227999,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6392479/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

2017,Deploying microservices for a cloud-based design of system-of-systems in intralogistics,"For the realization of flexible, reconfigurable manufacturing and logistics facilities, heterogeneous, autonomous, and interconnected intralogistics systems are being deployed on the shop-floor. However, the distributed and often emerging nature of such systems makes their design and integration into existing processes a rather complex engineering task that requires a lot of coordination from all stakeholders. Modern IT tools offer solutions, but often target only individual system aspects such as modeling and simulation and rarely address the continuous evolution and changing requirements of such intralogistics systems. In this work, we approach distributed intralogistics systems as a system of systems and present a cloud-based engineering design process using microservices. In order to enable distributed simulation and testing of intralogistics systems, we employ a service-oriented architecture at systems' model-level, to couple simulation engines through a cloud-based platform. The applicability of the concept is demonstrated by a case study using a Discrete Event System Specification simulation framework, presenting system configuration and interface specification at run-time.",10.1109/INDIN.2017.8104885,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8104885/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

The concept of System of systems (SoS) has become the key for creating new systems. Modeling is a central issue of SoS design and evolution. Since subsystems of a SoS can be modeled in different languages, the SoS modeling environment should be able to handle heterogeneous modeling formalism. Traditionally, this problem is handled through type-based model transformations which are rigid and static. In this paper we address this problem by proposing a role modeling language offering a dynamic and extensible way to interpret and connect models from different languages. An usage of the role modeling language on a seafloor observatory use case is shown.",10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116752,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2008,Reasoning about Hybrid System of Systems Designs,"Constructing a complex system-of-systems (SoS) involves integrating two or more components. When integrations overcome isolating mechanisms inherent to heterogeneous components, a SoS is a software hybrid. SoS designers are challenged to create a viable hybrid that reuses significant value from autonomous, component systems while allowing for new, SoS-wide properties to emerge and be reliably maintained. Thus, a SoS is a super-system integrating many designs, yet not identical to any of them. Formalisms beyond architecture definition languages for mismatch are needed to express SoS designs to terms of the properties and structures that promote the determination of the cause of hybrid failure and its resolution. This paper extends a formal specification language to SoS designs within a paradigm based on software speciation, where software systems experience divergent evolution under various forms of isolation to become incompatible. Examples from security audit are used to illustrate the application of the formalism.",10.1109/ICCBSS.2008.39,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4464020/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Typical approaches based on types fail in offering the needed dynamicity to answer the virtual prototyping requirements. In order to bridge the existing gap between system models and execution tools, we suggest an approach based on roles and parser combinatory. Roles provide a dynamic coupling between modelling and execution allowing independent evolution of modelling and execution. Parser combinatory ease the integration of new modelling formalisms.

Projects such as DANSE and COMPASS have selected the most relevant views among the numerous views of UPDM. By nature, an SoS evolves after its initial deployment. To deal with evolutions, the architect needs to model configurations, what was not considered in previous state of the art. Modeling configuration is indeed key before we can model the evolution itself. In this paper, our contribution is a new modeling process, based on UPDM and SysML, that helps the architect in designing the configuration of an SoS.

2023,Mission reliability modeling and evaluation for reconfigurable unmanned weapon system-of-systems based on effective operation loop,"The concept of unmanned weapon system-of-systems (UWSoS) involves a collection of various unmanned systems to achieve or accomplish a specific goal or mission. The mission reliability of UWSoS is represented by its ability to finish a required mission above the baselines of a given mission. However, issues with heterogeneity, cooperation between systems, and the emergence of UWSoS cannot be effectively solved by traditional system reliability methods. This study proposes an effective operation-loop-based mission reliability evaluation method for UWSoS by analyzing dynamic reconfiguration. First, we present a new connotation of an effective operation loop by considering the allocation of operational entities and physical resource constraints. Then, we propose an effective operation-loop-based mission reliability model for a heterogeneous UWSoS according to the mission baseline. Moreover, a mission reliability evaluation algorithm is proposed under random external shocks and topology reconfiguration, revealing the evolution law of the effective operation loop and mission reliability. Finally, a typical 60-unmanned-aerial-vehicle-swarm is taken as an example to demonstrate the proposed models and methods. The mission reliability is achieved by considering external shocks, which can serve as a reference for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of UWSoS.",10.23919/JSEE.2023.000082,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10185011/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2015,Catalysts of Cooperation in System of Systems: The Role of Diversity and Network Structure,"Cooperation and competition are critical aspects of complex systems that intrigue researchers and practitioners alike. Recently, there has been great interest in how structure affects these cooperative behaviors and how they evolve. In this paper, we utilize the methods of evolutionary game theory on graphs to develop a model of the structured evolution of adaptive agents. Rather than simple memoryless agents, we employ adaptive agents that take on a diverse set of strategies including the cooperative catalyst tit-for-tat (TFT) and its generous and suspicious variants. We also employ all-defect, unconditional cooperation, and random strategies. Agents use these strategies during their evolution in order to maximize their own relative fitness, measured by their performance in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game versus their structural neighbors. We test the model with a variety of regular graph structures with variable degree, randomness, and size. Our parallel-execution agent-based simulations show that each strategy evolves toward its own structural niche with suspicious TFT maintaining the highest survival rate over all structures. We also show that increases in network density make the TFT strategies even more dominant, and connectivity randomness encourages cooperation in sparse networks.",10.1109/JSYST.2013.2284959,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6658829/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2007,Keynote Hipel,"An encompassing perspective on competition and cooperation is presented for multiple participants strategically interacting within societal and technological systems of systems according to their underlying value systems as they strive to reach their goals. By appreciating the reality that systems of systems are inhabited by multiple participants or agents having multiple objectives, one can adhere to adaptive and integrative decision making principles to properly design, construct, maintain, and operate systems of systems that serve the interests of stakeholders in a fair and sustainable manner throughout the systems’ life cycles. An insightful way is explained for classifying systems of systems in the world according to environmental (natural world), societal (real life), intelligent (artificial life) and integrated (mixed life) systems of systems. To examine strategic behaviour in societal systems of systems, some of the latest contributions in systems thinking techniques are discussed for advancing the paradigm of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution including modeling value systems, taking preference uncertainty and strength of preference into account, describing how emotions can affect decision making under conflict, and tracing the evolution of a conflict from a status quo situation to a final equilibrium. A real world environmental conflict is employed to illustrate how cooperation among decision makers can produce a more preferred win/win resolution which cannot be reached when they behave independently in a purely competitive manner. In fact, tremendous opportunities abound for researchers and practitioners in systems, man and cybernetics to develop flexible smart systems tools in multiple participant-multiple objective decision making for both cooperative and independent interactive situations to tackle pressing global problems, such as climate change and globalization of trade, from a multidisciplinary viewpoint. Moreover, it is pointed out that universal multiple participant decision making techniques need to be developed or significantly expanded and improved for employment in many diverse kinds of systems of systems such that multi-agents’ value systems and protocols governing competitive and cooperative behaviour among agents are based upon ethical principles like the prioritization of societal well-being, social justice, environmental protection, and sustainable development. As exemplified by the sudden failure of the electrical system of systems in the northeastern part of the United States and the Canadian province of Ontario on August 14, 2003, adaptive and integrative policy and governance systems are required such that decisions can be made in real time based upon enormous amounts of data being collected over widespread areas so that appropriate remedial action can be instantaneously taken to isolate and rectify problems as they arise and thereby prevent total system collapse.",10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413571,,ieeeexplore

Agility (contemporary) versus rigidity (traditional) are approaches that have their trade-offs but to meet the demands and needs of our war-fighters, we must have an ESE process that allows us to deliver quality capabilities to the tactical edge. Governance plays a significant role and testing services needs to be addressed different from the traditional T&E of stovepiped systems. The traditional approach of building systems to deliver a specific function is being changed to an approach of architecting services. ESE utilizes defined processes that use managerial and technical tools to analyze problems and provide structure to the overall process of planning, procuring, designing, implementing and testing an enterprise system. Adding agility and assurance to the traditional and ESE is the process by which we build quality into complex systems while delivering functionality and security of contents in a manageable timeframe and stay flexible to meet emerging requirements. This study is based on architecting the GIG which is the ultimate complex system. Utilizing the DoD's framework to facilitate information sharing; which starts with data discovery and access, we analyzed several concepts to achieve agility and higher level of security in Information Sharing Systems.

The Evolutionary Systems Engineering Model for Unmanned System is based on the System of Systems (SoS) Systems Engineering (SE) Wave Model [2] adopted by the DoD as best practices for Systems of Systems System Engineering [3], [5]. The SoS Wave Model was adopted by SPAWAR Systems Center (SSC) Pacific's Unmanned Systems Group to enable the agile and rapid evolution of autonomous unmanned systems. It provides the backplane for the Unmanned Systems Integration, Test, and Experimentation (UxSITE) capability at SSC Pacific. It establishes a systematic process for technology insertion and overarching strategies for managing risk and ensuring key capability objectives are met as the system evolves. Implemented as a continuous improvement process, the Evolutionary System Engineering approach provides flexibility and adaptability to address the inevitable changes in both the technical landscape and the larger operational environment. This paper provides a description of the Evolutionary Systems Engineering Model, its drivers, and how implementation of the SoS Wave Model addresses them.",10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490597,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7490597/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2017,"Cybersecurity in the age of autonomous vehicles, intelligent traffic controls and pervasive transportation networks","Technologies for autonomous vehicles, “smart” roadways and ride-hailing services are advancing at a dizzying pace. They are also beginning to interconnect and interoperate to form complex systems-of-systems. The cyberattack surfaces of these systems-of-systems are expanding exponentially. Currently, many related systems are standalone, but when they are integrated, vulnerabilities of, and threats to, the resulting systems-of-systems could grow so much that they might well detract from the potential of these systems to improve safety and gain fuel use due to reduced travel times. Despite warnings, few are focusing on improving cybersecurity of the entire system-of-systems as the self-driving, ground-vehicle juggernaut ploughs ahead. Far too little attention is being paid to vulnerabilities throughout the systems-of-systems that will undoubtedly arise when the myriad of systems is interconnected and interoperate. In this paper, we discuss the cybersecurity consequences of the current uncoordinated evolution of these systems-of-systems and describe how such risks might be mitigated by, among other approaches, proactively introducing cybersecurity requirements early in the design, development and deployment process.",10.1109/LISAT.2017.8001966,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8001966/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2008,The Evolution of Systems Engineering,"The 21st century is an exciting time for the field of systems engineering. Advances in our understanding of the traditional discipline are being made. At the same time new modes of systems engineering are emerging to address the engineering challenges of systems-of-systems (SoS) and enterprise systems. Even at this early point in their evolution, these new modes are evincing their own principles, processes and practices. Some are different in degree than engineering at the system level while others are different in kind. While it is impossible to predict how the traditional and new forms of systems engineering will evolve, it is clear even now that there is a long and robust future for all three. Increases in technology complexity have led to new challenges in architecture, networks, hardware and software engineering, and human systems integration. At the same time, the scale at which systems are engineered is exceeding levels that could have been imagined only a short time ago. As a consequence, all three forms of systems engineering will be needed to solve the engineering problems of the future, sometimes separately but increasingly in combination. This paper defines three modes of systems engineering, discusses the challenge space each addresses, describes how they differ from and complement each other. It asks and starts to answer the question of how to enable the development of enterprise systems engineering in a defense department.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2008.4518992,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4518992/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2007,Using a Modular Open Systems Approach in Defense Acquisitions: Implications for the Contracting Process,"Many of the Department of Defense's (DoD) future warfighting capabilities are being acquired through the development of system of systems. These systems of systems are being developed and acquired using an evolutionary acquisition approach. Integral to both systems of systems and evolutionary acquisition is the use of a modular open systems approach (MOSA) for the design, development and acquisition of these weapon systems. MOSA is considered an enabler to both systems of systems engineering as well as evolutionary acquisition. This research explores the use of the modular open systems approach (MOSA) as a method for implementing an evolutionary' acquisition strategy as well as the implications of using such an approach on the contracting process. A background on evolutionary acquisition is provided highlighting the benefit of rapid development and production of weapon systems incrementally, with each increment providing an increasing level of capability. The contractual implications of using a modular open systems approach are then discussed, focusing on each of the six phases of the procurement process. The research then conclude with the identification of characteristics of a successful MOSA program procurement and resulting contract.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2007.4304231,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4304231/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Deepwater is an integrated, performance-based, systems of systems acquisition. Costing $17 billion over 20 years, it is the single largest and most complex acquisition in Coast Guard history. It is also the first major federal acquisition program for a broad mission suite using an integrated, systems of systems design. This strategy involves unique technical, operational and political risk factors that Deepwater and other large networked system of systems acquisitions must manage well if they are to be successful.

Not only must change be managed at the level of each component system, it must also be managed across the entire interrelated and interacting set. The solution presented in this paper is based on research that treats a class of warships in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), along with the associated operational, production and support systems, as a system-of-systems (SoS) and examines the management of change in this complex entity.

These forces and priorities are now converging and alert leaders recognize that engineering practices must converge, as well. Ideally the engineering profession will seek an intelligent convergence; one that preserves the current practices that are future-sufficient while innovating new practices where necessary. All engineers across these industries have much to learn from one another. However, the degree to which we converge the upstream, systems engineering practices will be the major determinant as to whether all other engineering disciplines will collaborate-or collide. Systems engineering practitioners and managers must respond to two kinds of challenges. Firstly, how to model and specify increasingly encompassing ""systems of systems"" in a way that proactively orchestrates their conjoint evolution? Secondly, how to manage change-profitably-which amounts to executing the classic ECP>ECN>ECO cycle with ten-fold more ramifications in each change while taking only one-tenth the time for change processing and decision.

This work is an extension of Hinton's work on ""under-specification"". Even though emergence is a universal phenomenon that can hardly be modeled, there are still attempts to understand, propose solution what is known by non-desired emergent properties in industrial systems design. This paper focuses also on under specification and impact of requirement evolution. Some approaches even appear to be infeasible as in natural systems; however industrial systems are designed following various methods and techniques and the interface to user is often poorly specified and developed. In that respect, interfaces between systems and human are very hard to model as emergent behavior is hardly predicted and hence largely unknown.

2003,Intelligent sensor resource management using evolutionary computing techniques,"Missile defense is moving toward a 'system of systems' approach creating a highly complex scheduling task for the overall battle manager. The battle management segment is responsible with managing all the available sensor resources for engagement planning and utilization of interceptor inventories. This has become a complex, at times intractable effort. To rectify the situation it has been suggested that battle manager tasking become more goal-oriented. This force a higher level of autonomy within individual sensing components, making the design of the sensor increasingly more challenging. Now each sensor will require a sophisticated sensor management processing scheme, which performs high-level intelligent resource scheduling. The sensor management process determines a viable solution for scheduling resources, including specifying parameters for the sensor activities of search, track, discrimination, and kill assessment. These activities are scheduled in accordance within the sensor constraints and limits.

2019,The System Life Cycle Turbine: A proposal for a Universal System Life Cycle Model in Aerospace and Defense,"Over decades many (product or system) life cycle models have evolved. More than 46 life cycle models from Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Systems Engineering (SE), and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) have been reviewed. Most models are from an engineering perspective. Hence, engineering topics are dominant in life cycle models. However, the complexity of modern systems demands more: Consideration for business, support, and operational aspects during life cycle; the visualization of system evolution, from an imaginary version and the digital twin to a (cyber-) physical system of systems; possible negative impact for performance of systems of systems through time drifts in production. Furthermore, Obsolescence Management (OM), Change Requests (CR), Midlife Upgrades (MLU) and Product Generation Engineering (PGE) trigger jumps from one life cycle phase to another. As a result, these 46 life cycle models have been consolidated into a new model which has been further developed to meet also the aforementioned requirements. The resulting model called System Life Cycle Turbine (SLCT) may be applied to different (hardware) systems (or products).

Exasperating the challenge is these systems are increasingly distributed creating new data fidelity and interoperability challenges for grid operators struggling to balance and incorporate distributed energy resources. Blockchain technology provides an atomically verifiable cryptographic signature to help increase the trustworthiness of energy delivery systems at the grid's edge. This is especially important as distribution level as energy delivery systems and field devices have increasing operational and security requirements that are often diametrically opposed: as data, speed and analytic requirements increase, security and functionality requirements increase, as the grid's edge incorporate distributed energy resources and transacts in real time, availability is prioritized over the integrity and confidentially of that data.

Due to significant knowledge gaps, architects may find it difficult to uncover the ramifications of a specific decision on various Measures-of-Effectiveness (MOEs) and emergent behavior of the SoS. Subsequently, for complex SoS, learning cycles maybe experienced on the architecture design decisions. As the SoS evolves, these experiential learnings need to be factored into the uncertainty assessments of decisions and the impacted SoS MOEs, while evaluating and deciding on a specific decision. This paper proposes a knowledge based decision learning framework that factors the learning cycles experienced into the uncertainty associated with the decisions and impacted SoS MOEs.

2007,Diagnostics To Prognostics - A Product Availability Technology Evolution,"From the customer's perspective, one of the most critical expectations of R&M in the new frontier focuses on product availability and cost of ownership. Whether you consider a personal automobile or a pilot's avionics, it must operate reliably, on demand, at an affordable cost. Consumer products such as automobiles, aircraft engines, medical diagnostic equipment, and computer server farms already employ remote diagnostics to monitor product health and optimize product availability. In this context, the next frontier is to evolve robust diagnostics into maturing prognostics and embed these technologies in our products in the form of health management system (HMS) capabilities. Using health based information for real time mission planning and autonomic maintenance is a key enabler for achieving ultra-reliability and availability in tomorrow's system of systems environment. The problem we face is how to best achieve these HMS capable products in a cost effective manner. Today's robust diagnostic technologies are proving to be key enablers for condition based maintenance, improved fault detection/fault isolation, and lower operational cost. Some success has been realized with the insertion of early prognostic technology, primarily in the area of mechanical PHM applications. By using a systematic methodology to develop, implement, and mature electronic prognostics into the next generation of HMS capable products, we are providing our customers (and most importantly the end user in the field) with new insight into the health and system readiness of our products.

The proposed method addresses the management of multi-energy flows in industrial integrated energy systems - incorporating multi-energy storage, renewable energy generation, energy conversion, and energy trading in a synchronous manner. The method considers the typical energy load of the industrial users, the energy price of the national grid and the trading platform, and the trade-off between investment costs and benefits from the various sub-systems. As this results in a complex system of systems, an artificial intelligence method is proposed to treat the problem, using reinforcement learning based differential evolution (RLDE), that can determine the optimal mutation strategy and associated parameters in an adaptive way.

The burgeoning Big Service computing just covers the significant challenges in constructing and maintaining a stable service-oriented SoS. A service-oriented SoS runs under a volatile and uncertain environment. As a step toward big service, service fault tolerance (FT) can guarantee the run-time quality of a service-oriented SoS. To successfully deploy FT in an SoS, online reliability time series prediction, which aims at predicting the reliability in near future for a service-oriented SoS arises as a grand challenge in SoS research. In particular, we need to tackle a number of big data related issues given the large and fast increasing size of the historical data that will be used for prediction purpose. The decision-making of prediction solution space be more complex. To provide highly accurate prediction results, we tackle the prediction challenges by identifying the evolution regularities of component systems' running states via different machine learning models.

We also propose a multi-steps trajectory DBNs (or multi_DBNs) to further improve the accuracy of future reliability prediction.

2014,Target evolution modeling for robotized adaptive radiotherapy,"Adaptive Radiotherapy Treatment (ART) of cancerous organs is based on manipulating Autonomous Robotic System (ARS) used for radiation. After each treatment session, the biological organ is subject to deformation. Treatment efficiency depends highly on predicting successfully the shape of the deformable organ, being treated, prior to commencement of a new session. We begin our study by focusing on recent methods being implemented in adaptive radiotherapy treatment. Then we investigate the structural organization of treatment method from technological and biological perspectives by applying the concept of System of Systems (SoS). Moreover, we present our contribution to ART by means of a predictive model that anticipates the deformation of cancerous organ (Biological System) and issue appropriate control commands needed for adapting the ARS (Technological System). In order to do this issue, we propose in this paper a modeling evolution of a biological target to be treated or avoided during the robotized radiation sessions. For this, a bi-cubic Bézier spline surface method has been applied to reconstruct the organ in 3D dimension. The reconstruction of an organ will allows us to track the deformation of biological organ. The results show that the studied organ (Parotid) is smoothly reconstructed and its center of gravity is identified kinematicaly after each treatment session, in order to elaborate a predictive model-based approach for adaptive robotized radiotherapy.",10.1109/AIM.2014.6878065,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

In particular we cite the experience of the team that authored the DoD systems engineering guide for systems of systems (SoS) [Ref 1]. They developed a representation of how successful SoS engineering practitioners view and do systems engineering that is substantially different from their individual system counterparts.

NextGen will fundamentally change NAS operations by implementing advanced technologies to monitor and operate aircraft. NextGen poses substantial systems integration challenges due to numerous technical, organizational, political, and social perspectives and their complex interdependencies. Specifically, this paper addresses the challenges associated with integrating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the NAS, utilizing systems-of-systems methodology to identify and assess the integration risks. The team started by studying simple systems-of-systems to explore how modeling such systems can be applied to more complex systems, such as NextGen. Due to NextGen's evolving nature, the team adopted a dynamic methodological roadmap to guide risk assessment. The roadmap, an iterative methodological approach, involves developing (i) a comprehensive Hierarchical Holographic Model to identify the UAS shared state variables that contribute most to potential risk resulting from UAS integration into the NAS, (ii) a list of risk scenarios that are critical for UAS integration into the NAS, (iii) a process for risk modeling, planning, assessment, management, and communication utilizing multi-objective decision tree analysis, and (iv) recommendations for applying lessons learned from analyzing UAS integration to other components of NextGen. Whereas the results of this study are focused on UAS integration into the NAS, the methodological roadmap and modeling techniques adopted in this study are general enough to be applied to other systems-of-systems supported by MITRE Corporation. The results of this study are expected to help MITRE and the FAA navigate other NAS integration challenges and benefit from the political, social and ethical implications of UAS integration.",10.1109/SIEDS.2012.6215142,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2011,Towards intelligent search support for web services evolution identifying the right abstractions,"Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) is becoming a popular style for building complex systems-of-systems that allow businesses to work together across organizational boundaries. However concerns have been raised about the comprehensibility and maintainability of SOA composite applications. Integrating and deploying SOA applications requires artifacts in a variety of web-based languages (WSDL, XSD, BPEL, etc.) often produced by code-generation tools. It becomes difficult for a human to discover and understand the dependencies between these artifacts in an existing system. In this paper, we describe ongoing research on using search techniques to facilitate SOA maintenance by allowing users to query collections of artifacts making up a SOA composite application. The main focus in this paper is a case study using our prototype search tool SOAMiner to identify a set of abstractions that extract useful and critical information for maintainers, thereby bridging the heterogeneity of SOA artifacts while opportunistically exploiting their structure. Results of the study indicate that the highest priority abstractions for SOA are datatype summaries, service invocation (calling) relationships, and data usage relationships.",10.1109/WSE.2011.6081819,,ieeeexplore; webofscience

System-of-systems approach brings reconfigurability for the production systems, but also increases the configuration need for the monitoring system for instance access right for different information and visualization methods for different user groups such as maintenance personnel, operators and managers. This paper presents an Arrowhead framework compliant solution for system-of-systems condition monitoring where several users require customized views and may have different access rights for the monitored information. The objective is to provide reconfigurable user interfaces for multiple users which can evolve during the operation life of the systems.",10.1109/IECON.2016.7794139,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2017,Augmented virtuality for the next generation production intelligence,"Several compelling IT trends of the past few years show us how the next possible paradigm change in business intelligence could remodel everything in production informatics. Along the example of Virtual Reality and a community-based granulated software ecosystem, namely the Node.js world and its interference with the System of Systems and Internet of Anything concepts, the presentation will uncover a really powerful future of Industrial software systems. Evolution of the Node.js world started back in 2008, when Google released the powerful V8 JavaScript engine and Ryan Dahl began using it as a general purpose virtual machine allowing millions of JS developers to create server-side or practically any computer applications for all purposes using common web technologies. Thanks to many beneficial conjunctions like the GitHub and Npm communities as well as the Node friendly PaaS (e.g., MS Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Bluemix, Heroku) today Node.js-based technologies aspire to be a common language of large-scale distributed Internet of Anything systems considering the non mission critical layers. Our research team investigates new ideas to connect distributed Industrial system elements (sensors, actuators, control logic, intelligent machines, data logging and data mining) to each other and represents them in a Virtual World forming a general purpose information pool which allows for large-scale heterogeneous production systems. The last part of the presentation summarizes the results and ideas of a newly developed software engine, called MAXWHERE that provides effective working environments with spatial (Virtual Reality) multimedia arrangement and Intelligent System of Systems connectivity. The fundamental idea behind MAXWHERE is the generalization of the Document Object Model (DOM) introducing the Where Object Model (WOM) concept that covers the conventional WEB contents as well as the VR/AR building blocks in a coherent way empowered by the newest generation web APIs. Typical applications of MAXWHERE includes industrial monitoring and facility support, context-based collaborative working environment, industrial training, and Interactive live presentations.",10.1109/INFORMATICS.2017.8327213,,ieeeexplore

2020,Towards an UML-based SoS Analysis and Design Process,"Systems of Systems or SoSs are an emerging class of systems built from large-scale constituent systems, that are often heterogeneous, with independent management, goals and resources. The heterogeneity and managerial independence of the constituent systems is both a strength and a drawback of SoS engineering. Although, the individual systems of an SoS may operate autonomously, their interactions present and usually provide important emerging properties that are constantly evolving. Therefore, coordination and interaction within the SoS constituent systems gives rise to an emerging behavior which defines the SoS overall goal. However, this may lead to unpredictable behavior (arrival/departure, failure to fulfill commitments) of the SoS constituent systems. As a result, a well-defined process for SoS engineering; where missions, capabilities and mainly the expected interactions of the constituent systems are well-established, is missing. Our objective in the present work is to propose an UML-based SoS analysis and design process (USDP). The process is iterative and incremental and will be instrumented and documented with various diagrams to ensure clarity and understandability of the USDP artifacts. Besides, a meta-model for SoS modelling will be defined, it mainly defines the SoS structure in terms of constituent systems, theirs missions, capabilities, and interactions. With the aim of reducing the abstraction of interactions and in order to ensure a high interoperability, a precise and coherent definition of the interactions among the heterogenous constituent systems of an SoS is given to make the description of the SoS more truthful. From a practical point of view, we develop a graphical editor for modeling an SoS, based on the strengths of the MDE approach.",10.1109/ICAASE51408.2020.9380112,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2010,Pattern qualifications and examples of next-generation agile system-security strategies,"Current system security strategies are failing and cannot be fixed by security engineers alone. The reason for failure is evident: the attack community operates as an intelligent, multi-agent, self organizing, system-of-systems - with swarm intelligence, tight learning loops, fast evolution, and dedicated intent. Next generation security must engage in true co-evolution, engaging in this arms race with systemic self-organization that leverages community and other forms of multiagent architectures at least equally agile to the adversary in six observed common characteristics: self organization, adaptable tactics, reactive resilience, evolvable strategies, proactive innovation, and harmonious operations. These concepts cannot be effectively employed by security engineers on sufficient scale without first being enabled by system engineers working at the architectural level. But even then, without appreciation and concurrence by decision makers, self-organizing strategies will fail to gain sufficient deployment. The principal impediment to developing and fielding these strategies is not lack of know-how, but rather lack of a common language and vision that can remove the decision-maker distrust of self organization and unite system engineers and security engineers in architecturally synergistic solutions. This article reports on a cross-discipline pattern project that is discovering and cataloging patterns of self-organizing system-of-systems security. Pattern cataloging projects generally collect best practice history within a single domain. This cross-domain project is necessarily looking into many domains to find recurrent patterns across ecological systems, biological systems, social systems, network systems, enterprise systems, multi-agent systems, ad-hoc networks, unmanned autonomous systems, and others. The intent is to find multiple examples supporting each pattern drawn from disciplines that are comfortable to systems engineers, security engineers, and decision makers-leading to a design and strategy language meaningful to all three. This project began and continues with graduate studies at Stevens Institute of Technology's School of Systems and Enterprises, was adopted as a project activity by the INCOSE System Security Engineering Working Group, and is indicating potential for broader viral spread.

2014,CSG End-to-End System Deployment and Calibration within the Evolved Mission Scenario,"COSMO-SkyMed Seconda Generazione (CSG) represents the follow-on mission of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) currently operating with the full constellation in orbit, characterized by the capability to guarantee operational continuity and most of all improvements in terms of performances and architectural enhancements at both space segment and ground segment level. By exploiting the peculiar characteristics of flexibility and expandability of the CSK system, CSG will integrate innovative technological elements that will make possible new and more advanced civil and military applications [1]. The high Earth observation capability provided by CSG will fully meet the future needs of the entire country and will be shared by the Italian Defence with the European defense community in the frame of the ""System of Systems"" European agreements. The design of the new generation system is conducted on the basis of the experience of the first generation and is therefore upgraded and evolved in both architectural/operational design and logics of satellite and instrument management. The lesson learned and the new demanding needs of CSG mission in terms of image quality performances led also to the evolution of CSK Calibration and Validation functions and capabilities (CALVAL). The new SAR operative modes and performances, have driven the development of new image quality processors as well as the evolution of the existing algorithms. Accurate models of new passive calibrators have been developed with the aim to improve radiometric and geometric accuracies. The handling of higher data volume (e.g. dual polarization) and the generation of calibration tables to comply with new demanding requirements (e.g. geolocation) have been also challenging drivers of the new CALVAL design that will be in charge of all the verification, validation and certification activities. Objective of the paper is to present such concepts, highlighting the optimizations and upgrades that have been taken into account in the end-to-end design of the CSG mission with particular reference to the customer operational and certification needs.",,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Citizens and businesses have dynamic and evolving demands related to the complexity of their lives and operational environments, respectively. A major challenge for government is to be able to understand the value derived from investment in eGovernment in order to improve its consequent ability to respond to the variety of demands of its citizens and businesses. To be able to understand the value derived from planned investments in eGovernment, their analysis needs to extend beyond the familiar approaches that address economies of scale and scope to encompass economies of alignment.

1992,Interoperability problems-prevention is better than cure,"For many years there has been a tendency for very large scale systems to be conceived and built as an amalgamation of a number of smaller systems. Such 'systems of systems' appear to be merely extensions of the normal engineering practice in which systems are made up of a number of sub-systems which can often operate independently to perform a complete function of some sort and so be properly defined as smaller systems in their own right. Given this, why do the large 'systems of systems' or 'supersystems' seem to produce a disproportionate number of problems when compared to their smaller counterparts? The problem in evolving the supersystem is how to integrate the component systems so that they work as a combined whole. The answer clearly lies in achieving interoperability between them, and experience is that this has very rarely been as successful as intended. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the nature of supersystems, to describe interoperability and its role in the development of such systems, and to propose a means for reducing the risk of interoperability problems occurring. The method proposed relies upon the concepts of OSI and recognises the importance and role of the operator as part of the system.<>",,,ieeeexplore

The potential of services to form complex systems of systems, with emergent behaviour, necessitates the need to understand how we can we develop sufficient confidence in their qualities. In this paper we argue that successful development and evolution of service oriented computing is dependent on making informed decisions at the architectural level. This poses a number of challenges concerning how to evaluate such system architectures and the measurements and metrics that are important in their assessment.

2007,Enterprise IT support for NOAA Archives,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for archiving and disseminating environmental data collected by a variety of ground and space-based observing systems. Integrating data management across NOAA represents a significant change in NOAA business practices that will require evolution of the management structures and approaches used in NOAA for data management. Historically, archive and dissemination activities have been implemented in dedicated ""stovepipe"" systems, each focusing on the needs of a particular data collection and its associated user community. Exponential data volume growth, increasing data diversity, user requirements for common and consistent access methods across data types, and the need for economic efficiency are driving a consolidation of the information technology (IT) systems that support NOAA archives. The Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) is a result of this consolidation; CLASS is the enterprise IT solution in support of NOAA archives. Against this backdrop, the meaning of ""archive"" is itself changing as the challenges of long-term digital preservation are better understood. It is no longer sufficient to simply preserve ""bits."" Instead, information content is the target of preservation, with ""bits"" simply providing a medium for representing information. The ISO standard ""Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System"" (OAIS-RM) provides a conceptual framework that describes the responsibilities and activities of organizations attempting to preserve digital information. Applying the OAIS-RM to NOAA's archive efforts provides the means to identify high-level archive responsibilities, delegate roles to various NOAA organizational components, and describe the means by which these entities work together to fulfill archive requirements. At the highest level, NOAA archives maintain and apply information- and user-specific knowledge while CLASS provides IT capabilities in support of archive activities. Together, the archives and CLASS provide the necessary ingredients to fulfill NOAA's archive mission. Currently, CLASS holds POES, DMSP, GOES, and MetOp data. Planned future campaigns include NPP, NPOESS, EOS MODIS, NEXRAD, and model and in-situ data. To ensure the preservation of these data, CLASS has implemented a multiple site distributed system that replicates data and metadata holdings automatically. Additionally, CLASS supports the deployment of ""points of presence"" that allow the co-location of key CLASS capabilities with high-volume or otherwise critical data producers or consumers to mitigate economic constraints or meet quality-of-service requirements. Among the key challenges facing CLASS are: massive increases in data volumes, the extraordinary diversity of NOAA data, evolving user needs and requirements, and the ever-changing technology environment. CLASS must address all of these challenges - and more - at the same time it ensures the safeguarding and availability of its current holdings. CLASS is evolving toward a service-oriented architecture that provides the flexibility, scalability, and generality necessary to accommodate the vast amount of change in its environment and at the same time provide interoperability with other systems and systems of systems necessary to support NOAA's position in the environmental data arena. Adoption of standards is critical to NOAA's success, and CLASS is working with NOAA's Global Earth Observation Integrated Data Environment (GEO-IDE) project to identify standards that will ensure CLASS'S interoperability with other NOAA systems. The lack of broad, uniform utilization of IT standards that adequately meet NOAA's data integration needs is arguably the most acute factor contributing to the weakness of data integration today. GEO-IDE will ultimately ensure that key NOAA systems, including CLASS, are interoperable within NOAA, with US-Global Earth Observation System (US-GEO), and ultimately with US-Global Earth Observation System (GEOSS). In addition to its work with GEO-IDE, CLASS is also developing pilots for geospatial capabilities, and dissemination standards to facilitate interoperability and meet user needs. This paper will present the guiding principles and lessons learned while developing CLASS to date. We will discuss our challenges, accomplishments, and future work, as well as how CLASS aligns with NOAA's strategic goals.",10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423732,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2023,Research on Large-Scale Heterogeneous Combat Network Optimization based on SP-RV-Moeanet Algorithm,"The research on robustness optimization of large- scale heterogeneous combat network(HCN) is of great significance to improve the ability of combat system-of-systems(CSOS) to work in complex battlefield environment. However, there are still some shortcomings in the existing research, including the single setting attack strategy and the high computational cost in the search process of the optimization algorithm. In this article, we address aforementioned problems by using an computationally efficient evolutionary algorithm SP-RV-MOEANet to optimize the robustness of HCN. More specifically, two robust network parameters for node attack and link attack are first determined, then multi-objective optimization of HCN is carried out for these two parameters. Last, we analyze the results population and the optimal individual topology. Results show that the SP-RV-MOEANet has a satisfactory optimization effect for large-scale HCN, especially the optimization effect of robustness parameter for node attack is significantly better than that for link attack. On the other hand, by comparing the network topology before and after optimization, we find that the link from Sensor entities to Influential entities is more important. This finding provides useful insights for design of more robust combat system-of-systems.",10.1109/IDITR57726.2023.10145995,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2022,Validation of Assurance Case for Dynamic Systems,"Aviation safety has accrued and applied decades of understanding on known risks and effective mitigations. That knowledge captured in compliance standards - can be tested for predictable outcomes. Autonomy that involves learning systems tend to be dynamic and may continuously be adapting to their environment. Such continuous adaptation has inherent unknown risks depending upon the guardrails imposed on the learning systems. Design assurance and use of traditional standards are inadequate for these dynamic systems.Assurance Cases are used to present an argument for the assurance of systems. Dynamic systems require that assurance cases be continuously validated. One method of validation is using real time collection of Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) which are crafted during the development of the system. This paper presents the need for SPIs and methods for creating and nurturing the SPIs to help all stakeholders. This method shadows regulations and allows risk-based approvals that may be applied for both conventional and for novel technology.Aviation is facing enormous growth in autonomous technology, reuse of components of unknown pedigree, and new aircraft designs that do not fit into Type classification. Mitigations are more heavily connected to operations, training, and other components of the ecosystem itself. The challenge is to make an assurance case for vehicles within the ecosystem. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by dynamically changing autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions to build safer systems.UL 4600, a Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products applies to fully autonomous road vehicles. The goal-based, technology-neutral features of UL 4600 have been extended to apply to aviation. So applied, the assurance process is adaptable to innovation and discovery while encouraging the current practices of standards compliance and taking a System of Systems (SoS) view. It proposes an assurance case that is an organized argument that a system is acceptable for its intended use with respect to specified concerns (such as safety, security, correctness). This paper gives guidance for validation of an assurance case through monitoring SPI within the operational context. The method by monitoring safety performance indices in the operational environment provides continued validation even as the ecosystem, components and controls change.For approval of novel systems including UAS and AAM, with features that do not lend themselves to traditional compliance methods, regulators have embraced the Safety Continuum perspective, which focuses on safety performance achieving expected outcomes. The performance-based assurance methods can be used with initially wider performance margins for certification of novel products, components of unknown pedigree, and autonomous vehicles. As the performance range is better known the margins can be decreased.Further, this paper recognizes that a one-time initial approval/acceptance is not adequate for learning systems and novel features. The continued validation through performance supports fast-paced development and product evolution. The initial assurance case for a product can limit risk through a closed environment until the margin for some unknowns is validated. for example, if the performance of collision avoidance function using new technology is not known, larger alert limits may be implemented until more confidence is gained after validating the assurance case via SPIs.The approach of monitored SPI throughout the life of the product is now feasible with the aid of big data processing. The aviation industry is already using similar methods for identifying maintenance problems. As systems grow more autonomous, more machine-to-machine exchanges are involved, making it easy to extend the monitoring and prediction practices to SPI.The method also allows for variants and derivatives of the baseline to have their own assurance case within the context of the baseline argument. The key is replacing design approval with through-life assurance that connects continuous operational safety into both the design and airworthiness determinations. The determination is predicated on the monitored SPIs and predicted performance of the product remaining consistent with the assurance argument predictions. This enables even complex automated products to be audited for airworthiness with an evolving ecosystem based on monitored and predictive data.Another advantage of the performance-based assurance case is the public comprehensibility of safety. With SPIs and predictions of performance the automobile segment has paved the way for public scrutiny of automated vehicles. The use of SPIs in aeronautical product assurance will facilitate transparency. This could be accomplished through appropriate dashboards to aid public perception and explain events and precautions taken during the evolution toward more autonomous aviation vehicles. This could reflect a stepwise evolution of complexity.This paper explores how the aviation industry can apply performance-based assurance case methods to assure new and novel as well as systems of unknown pedigree. The same framework could then be extended to autonomous systems and new types of aircraft which do not fit the current Type classification. One of the major benefits of this technology agnostic method are faster risk-based approvals of novel technology within a Safety Continuum.",10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925731,,ieeeexplore; scopus

2004,Attacking agent-based systems,"Agent-based systems add unique aspects to assessment activity and require the use of traditional tools and techniques in new or unconventional ways and the development of new, domain-customized tools. Agent-based system assessments must address the same issues as those of traditional systems: unsafe programming practices, such as failure to validate inputs or use of insecure libraries. Assessments of agent-based systems should also include ""system-of-systems"" concepts. Complex systems interact with and rely on other systems that may exist independently. A system-of-systems assessment identifies systems and their behaviors and considers ways that those behaviors can interact to harm the complex system. Attacks are then developed to cause the desired behavior. Agent-based systems are aware of and respond to their environment through adaptation and evolution. They require assessment through concepts normally reserved for humans. Just as adversaries cause humans to react in ways advantageous to the attacker, agent-based system assessors must cause agents to react. These assessments require ""social engineering"" of the agents just as simpler systems may require ""social engineering"" of users and administrators. This paper discusses the application of existing and new tools and techniques to agent system assessments including descriptions of actual and theoretical attacks.",10.1109/MASSUR.2004.1368415,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2011,A Transformative Software Development Framework: Reflecting the paradigm shift in social computing,"Social computing and networking has caused a dramatic evolution in the way people collaborate and interact via the Internet. Essentially, social computing represents the collection of technologies that gather, process, compute, and visualize social information. This new social structure has emerged creating an array of loosely integrated social components. However, a paradigm shift is needed to adopt a social computing model that enables the social aspects of Web 2.0 and other social computing technologies to be viewed as individual systems. These systems would then have the ability to integrate in a variety of new ways that enhances the user experience like never before. This problem can be solved by applying a system of systems framework, which treats each component as a separate system. Each system communicates as a set of defined processes with specific inputs and outputs. This creates a collection of social computing systems that are easily reusable and scalable reducing the complexity involved in integrating these systems. The Transformative (Interdisciplinary) Software Development Framework defines a process for building a system as a collection of sub- or meta- systems. In this paper we apply the Transformative Software Development Framework to social computing.

2010,Constructing program management framework,"Programs are aimed at achieving long term objectives that create value to stakeholders. They consist of a portfolio of projects, each of which aims at achieving specific sub-goals. A program emerges as a system of systems (SoS) when these projects are connected in a systemic way to accomplish program objectives. This entails that programs have an architecture that defines how the various projects interact to accomplish the overall objectives. Current program management approaches, however, largely treat programs as a collection of projects that are managed operationally to optimize outcomes at each level, rather than as a system to be architected. This paper develops a systemic architecture for programs in terms of three interconnected facets: value realization, program construction and program execution, and highlights the role of program worldview in this. Each of these facets brings out some aspects of the way in which projects relate to each other within a program. We propose an iterative framework in which models are developed for addressing each facet, but there is also an overall structure of activity and information flows that facilitates interplay and co-evolution of the models. The result is a holistic approach to managing programs as a system of systems, at a level over and above project management.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482471,,ieeeexplore

2008,Autonomous Farming: Modeling and Control of Agricultural Machinery in a Unified Framework,"Currently, there are significant challenges faced by the farming industry, not least of which are a reduction in the available labour workforce, and a more 'corporate' style of farming. Such factors demand an increase in farming efficiency and productivity. This paper looks forward to the not too distant future, where the realisation of autonomous farming will aid in the farming communities surviving as well as competing in the global market. In this work, the autonomous farm is seen as a complex system-of-systems, where there is necessarily a seamless integration of requirements, bringing together the areas of robotics for autonomous farming, and precision agriculture (PA), which deals with issues of agronomy. In essence, agricultural robotics uses on-farm sensing and control to actuate autonomous farm machinery with the aim of satisfying agronomy-based objectives. We initially describe a system-of-systems architecture, or unified framework, where a vital building block is the existence of two data sets used as links, or communication, between the various sub-systems. These data sets include a precision farming data set (PFDS) formed off-line before crop cultivation, containing spatially precise navigation data for any and all autonomous machinery, and a precision agriculture data set (PADS), which is a continually evolving entity consisting more of agronomy data in relation to the crop. Secondly, research undertaken in autonomous farm machinery is highlighted, where we present a foundation for the autonomous and robust control of articulated farm vehicles for real-time trajectory tracking in the presence of uncertain conditions. Preliminary results are shown, highlighting the autonomous control of vehicles for the operations of crop seeding and non-herbicidal weeding.",10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749583,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

The C4ISR architecture framework is at the center of all developments, that provides the templates (called ""views"") of how to capture C4ISR system design information, and it's intended operational use. While this framework is still valid, the current use of the framework lacks the rigor and consistency of a theoretical systematic approach of how to generate and interrelate the underlying design data. In this paper we present a rigorous mathematical framework augmenting the existing architecture framework, to provide a systematic way of capturing and generating the C4ISR system design data and translating it in standard architecture framework views. The approach starts with defining a metamodel of the design, which is used to capture the system of systems (SoS) design parameters, the sub-system design parameters, and their relationships with the operating requirements. We then define the C2, communications and sensor requirements/capabilities of the system, and through a rigorous mathematical framework of relating this data with operational data about the intended use, we create a set of analytical expressions that generate data which when put in the appropriate format form the basis of the C4ISR architecture views. This way we have full traceability between the system design and the architecture framework views. This approach is rigorous, systematic, and can generate all the data and the architecture views in much shorter timelines and greater consistency and accuracy, while providing a much more robust basis for the design.",10.1109/MILCOM.2004.1493242,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2016,Internet of Things: Proposed security aspects for digitizing the world,"The Internet is a Heterogeneous entity which is constantly changing and evolving. The concept of “Internet of Things” (IOT) refers to extending the intelligent sensors in our day to day objects such as televisions, fridge, media players, heating appliances etc. This would help in extending the ability of the objects to provide feedback to the user. This enables the object to have some sort of consciousness. What we have today is the human interacting with the object and not vice-versa, but the IOT would help us to complete this loop. This kind of digitization would mean that our next generation of refrigerators would know more about our diet then our current dieticians. This would help in creating a “system of systems”. Considering a current scenario where the number of digital security threats and attacks are increasing day by day, the notion of IOT would be incomplete if we ignore its security aspects. In this paper, we would be exploring the various security aspects of IOT such as security of remote frequency identifiers(RFID), wireless sensors etc. We have proposed a taxonomy of the security aspects of IOT. We have also explained the basic concepts and motivation behind the evolution of IOT, its architecture, and applications.",,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2021,Design considerations introducing analytics as a “dual use” in complex industrial embedded systems,"Embedded systems are today often self-sufficient with limited and predefined communication. However, this traditional view of embedded systems is changing through advancements in technologies such as, communication, cloud technologies, and advanced analytics including machine learning. These advancements have increased the benefits of building Systems of Systems (SoS) that can provide a functionality with unique capabilities that none of the included subsystems can accomplish separately. By this gain of functionality the embedded system is evolving towards a “dual use” purpose11In this paper we define dual usage as a control system having two purposes. In other contexts such as politics, diplomacy and export control, the term “dual-use” refers to technology that can be used for both peaceful and military aims, e.g., nuclear power technology., The use is dual in the sense that the system still needs to handle its original task, e.g., control and protect of an asset, and it must provide information for creating the SoS. Larger installations, e.g., industry plants, power systems and generation, have in most cases a long expected life-cycle, some up to 30–40 years without significant updates, compared to analytical functions that evolve and change much faster, i.e., requiring new types of data sets from the subsystems, not know at its first deployment. This difference in development cycles calls for new solutions supporting updates related to new requirements inherent in analytical functions. In this paper, within the context of “dual usage” of systems and subsystems, we analyze the impact on an embedded system, new or legacy, when it is required to provide analytic data with high quality. We compare a reference system, implementing all functions in one CPU core, to three other alternative solutions: a) a multi-core system where we are using a separate core for analytics, b) using a separate analytics CPU and c) analytics functionality located in a separate subsystem. Our conclusion is that the choice of analytics information collection method should to be based on intended usage, along with resulting complexity and cost of updates compared to hardware cost.",10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613273,,ieeeexplore

2014,Towards synchronous deterministic channels for the Internet of Things,"Embedded systems are omnipresent in our daily lives and rapidly gaining more and more importance, with performance improvements and technological evolutions in several directions. One of the most promising directions of evolution is in their interconnection. Already today there is a broad variety of use cases for interconnected embedded systems (automobiles, airplanes, automated production halls, etc.) and the most cutting edge examples demand the distributed embedded systems to tightly couple their operation. As a direct result of this tight coupling, stringent requirements on the underlying communication network immediately arise. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) as a discipline and movement to systematically connect distributed embedded systems on large or even Internet-like scales, promises a new generation of systems and system-of-systems. In order to also enable tight coupling of embedded systems in the IoT, there is a need for deterministic communication channels with predictable and low communication latency and jitter. In this paper we discuss how synchronous deterministic channels can be developed for the IoT by application of the time-triggered communication paradigm and other technology standards currently under development.",10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803205,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2023,"NASA’s Safety, Reliability, and Mission Assurance Digital Future","SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONSThe evolution from ""document-centric"" to ""data-centric"" and ""model-centric"" information leveraging structured data and model-based approaches is at the heart of digital engineering transformational efforts underway across industry and government. It is these approaches that pave the way for data lakes, Authoritative Sources of Truth (ASOTs), and systems-of-systems interoperability and the corresponding transformational benefits thereof. Such benefits include increased data availability, data access equity, data traceability, real-time analytics, batch analytics, and (most importantly) acceleration of the time-to-value and time-to-insights associated with engineering products and analyses. The longer-term benefits of reusability, customization and traceability are even more promising.For Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA), and Mission Success (SMS) activities; realization of such benefits is essential to provide engineers and analysts alike vital information when needed to support critical decision making throughout the entire life cycle. The SMA community often operate in parallel with engineering activities, for which information exchange with relevant context is paramount. Far too often, such information lags key decision points and/or is absent of the robust, integrated, knowledge needed, given inherent barriers associated with traditional document-centric means to data sharing, analysis, and reporting.This paper provides an overview of how NASA’s Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evolving its policies, standards, guidance, and training to transform to eliminate such barriers, thus realizing the benefits emerging in this new digital era. A roadmap for achieving this digital future is presented along with key building blocks involving use and implementation of concepts such as: Objectives-Hierarchies, Objective-Driven Requirements, Accepted Standards, Safety and Assurance Cases, data digitization (i.e., ontologies, structured data, and model-centric data), FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, & Reusable) and/or FAIRUST (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Understandable, Secure, and Trusted) principles [1]. This paper also describes how OSMA, leveraging the Agency’s overall commitment to Digital Transformation (DT), is using the power of Policy, ""Digital"" Domain representation, Product Evolution, and Community Outreach and Engagement as part of a strategic vision and roadmap to evolve and transform its SMA organizations to become better able to serve its stakeholders and customers.

In this study, from the view of “structure, state, evolution”, firstly proposed a fundamental measure framework for SoS's capability, which includes performance or effectiveness measure, SoS topology measure and state evolution measure; secondly presented the paradigms and algorithm of the fundamental measures on the analysis of capability-generating structures and capability state evolution of the complex SoS.

In Systems of Systems (SoS) engineering, a special case of complex systems, they help to better understand and identify the side effects associated with the integration of autonomous constituent systems. Simulation is also a way of apprehending the emerging behaviors from this integration. The dynamic and evolving nature of the SoS environment has led us to rely on the most stable part to define them, namely their mission. In this paper we propose a simulation framework for SoS based on a conceptual model defining the mission. Mission is defined as a set of situations that require reactions. Situations are defined by rules on facts related to the SoS environment. Reactions are defined as orchestrations of services from constituent systems (subsystems) that must be triggered when a situation is identified.We present this simulation approach through an SoS case study on health assistance.",10.1109/WETICE.2017.25,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2017,SoS GaP Slicer: Slicing SoS Goal and PRISM Models for Change-Responsive Verification of SoS,"A System-of-Systems (SoS) is a collection of systems, which consists of independent constituent systems to achieve higher-level goals. As an SoS changes constantly due to external and internal factors, dynamic reconfiguration and evolutionary development must be performed effectively. To manage an SoS that has these characteristics, SoS managers and engineers need to model and verify an SoS that accommodates changes. While many researchers have proposed techniques for modeling and verifying an SoS, little attention has been paid to the verification of a continuously changing SoS. Since the size and complexity of SoSs are too great to apply existing verification techniques, an efficient verification method for dynamically changing SoSs is required. If we can detect the change-related goals of an SoS and the corresponding change-affected parts in an SoS model, we can slice the SoS model in our area of concern and verify the SoS model efficiently. This paper proposes SoS GaP slicer, a verification method that considers the dynamic reconfiguration and evolution of an SoS. Our method could save the cost of verifying the whole of an SoS model by an efficient statistical model checking for SoSs. The experimental results show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.",10.1109/APSEC.2017.63,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Providing security in a cyber-physical SoS means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities and consequently detecting emerging phenomena resulting from the interactions among entailed Constituent Systems. This paper clarifies the relations occurring among SoS evolution, emergence phenomena and security requirements. We show how to enact an evolution step by means of changing SoS functionalities and how to perform the threat analysis consequently. An illustrative scenario in the Smart City domain shows how to dynamically generate security guarantees according to the evolving SoS thus supporting the enactment of mitigation strategies from SoS administrators.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2016.7542895,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7542895/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Five core concepts and relationships provide the foundation for the approved IEEE 1471 version: every system has an architecture, but an architecture is not a system; an architecture and an architecture description are not the same thing; architecture standards, descriptions, and development processes can differ and be developed separately; architecture descriptions are inherently multiviewed; and separating the concept of an object's view from its specification is an effective way to write architecture description standards. IEEE 1471 focuses on both software intensive systems and more general systems, such as information systems, embedded systems, systems-of-systems, product lines, and product families in which software plays a substantial role in development, operation, or evolution.",10.1109/2.917550,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/917550/,ieeeexplore; googlescholar
2018,A Maude based Specification for SoS Architecture,"Systems of Systems (SoS) are an emergent class of complex systems where the process of architecting and/or developing these systems differs in important ways from other types of complex systems. Usually, SoS are built from components that are large-scale systems in their own right. SoS concerns, such as dispersion, dynamic evolution and emergent behaviour are closely related to communications nature that may exist between sub components. This paper explores an architectural modeling method where communications and relationships in SoS are explicitly and well defined. An Architectural Description Language (called ArchSoS) dedicated to the specification of SoS is proposed. Then a formal semantics based on rewriting logic, through its high-level implementation language Maude, is associated to all SoS architectural elements. This semantic ensures the connectivity (over time) of SoS sub-systems, and the emergence of new SoS services. An illustration of our approach on a Maritime Transport case study is described.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428738,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2013,Applying model based systems engineering to NASA's space communications networks,"System engineering practices for complex systems and networks now require that requirement, architecture, and concept of operations product development teams, simultaneously harmonize their activities to provide timely, useful and cost-effective products. When dealing with complex systems of systems, traditional systems engineering methodology quickly falls short of achieving project objectives. This approach is encumbered by the use of a number of disparate hardware and software tools, spreadsheets and documents to grasp the concept of the network design and operation. In case of NASA's space communication networks, since the networks are geographically distributed, and so are its subject matter experts, the team is challenged to create a common language and tools to produce its products. Using Model Based Systems Engineering methods and tools allows for a unified representation of the system in a model that enables a highly related level of detail. To date, Program System Engineering (PSE) team has been able to model each network from their top-level operational activities and system functions down to the atomic level through relational modeling decomposition. These models allow for a better understanding of the relationships between NASA's stakeholders, internal organizations, and impacts to all related entities due to integration and sustainment of existing systems. Understanding the existing systems is essential to accurate and detailed study of integration options being considered. In this paper, we identify the challenges the PSE team faced in its quest to unify complex legacy space communications networks and their operational processes. We describe the initial approaches undertaken and the evolution toward model based system engineering applied to produce Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) PSE products. We will demonstrate the practice of Model Based System Engineering applied to integrating space communication networks and the summary of its results and impact.

2016,Aggressive congestion control mechanism for space systems,"The concept of a space system of systems (SoS) is becoming a key consideration in space communication, navigation, and Earth observation. The space SoS is defined as a network of assets on the Earth, in orbit around the Earth, in orbit around solar system bodies and on the surface of solar system bodies that is interconnected and/or interoperated to perform a mission, and/or provide services that cannot be performed by monolithic space systems alone. However, current space information systems are basically operated in a point-to-point pattern between the control center and the spacecrafts, which are only adequate for the individual space missions rather than collaborative missions. In other words, the ground network, space network, and the deep-space network evolve independently and focus on their individual communication regimes. To address these issues, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has developed an integrated space system that integrates the Internet protocols, routers, and interfaces into space networks [3], [4]. The space system, which is also called space Internet, enables large quantities of collaborative operations of those networks. Therefore, the integrated space Internet is essentially an SoS.",10.1109/MAES.2016.150117,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2010,A systemic approach to governance in extended enterprise systems,"This paper is an effort to introduce Enterprise Systems Governance (ESG) as a new systemic approach to governance within the System of Systems (SoS) environment. The proposed interdisciplinary approach combines theories of complexity and social sciences with those developed for systems and networks to: theorize problems of Extended Enterprise Systems (EES); explore how they are governed; and study how their governance structure strives for effectiveness over time. ESG adopts qualitative insights from complexity theories fundamentals, organizational behavior studies, systems thinking tools, and social sciences, and supports them with quantitative procedures and techniques such as agent-based modeling, social network analysis, dynamic systems analysis, and game theory to create new set of methodologies, tailored for governing EES. We believe that ESG can be expanded to become a new field of science that will address the need for a fundamental understanding of how organizational architectures evolve around technological systems and processes to generate complex network-based structures.

2012,COAST: An Architectural Style for Decentralized On-Demand Tailored Services,"Decentralized systems are systems-of-systems whose services are governed by two or more separate organizations under distinct spheres of authority. Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services. COAST combines mechanisms from software architecture, cryptography, security, and programming languages, granting application architects flexible provisioning of their core services and assets while protecting those services and assets from attack and misuse.",10.1109/WICSA-ECSA.212.15,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2017,IoT architecture for urban agronomy and precision applications,"In recent years, climate change, high population rates, water scarcity, contaminated farmland, eroding soils, and other factors, have raised serious concerns in the area of sustainable food production. In addition, it has been estimated that by 2050, as much as 80 percent of the earths population will reside in cities [1]. As a consequence, new forms of food production have been explored, especially in places close to or even within the consumption areas, that is, cities. In this context, cities are evolving into intelligent infrastructures in which the aim is to automate, optimize, and improve all possible aspects, including urban agriculture and precision agronomy. Despite recent research efforts, common grounds still have to be defined in terms of how to efficiently automate and provide intelligence to the urban agriculture implementations and integrate those in a transparent and scalable manner to the overall smart city solutions. For this, we believe that smart cities must be conceptualized and abstracted on a higher and different plane than the supporting information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. However, the essential properties that make a city smart or a system of systems must be the architectural design assets of the underlying planes. This paper presents a conceptual IoT architecture for urban farming and precision agronomy in Smart Cities based on Software Defined Networks (SDNs) and Cyber-physical systems.

Feature extraction from the 3-D sediment volume imagery is described. Image classification using a joint Gaussian Bayesian classifier is demonstrated with synthetic 2-D image classification experiments that employ image clustering and ellipse feature extraction methods. The signal classifier is demonstrated with data collected from mine-like and clutter objects buried in sand. These tests utilize data from different run orientations and transmit angles for training, cross validation and testing, achieved 5-class classification levels of 94% and 2-Class ROC curve knee values of Pcc=96% and Pfc=4%, and thus illustrate the buried mine-hunting potential for time-frequency based signal classification.",10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178631,,ieeeexplore; scopus; scopus; webofscience

2008,Active Media: A framework for digital media effectiveness,"This paper defines active media as a new paradigm that captures the richness of digital media in affecting every aspect of our lives. The term active media embraces interactive, coactive, and proactive digital media. Active media provide more dynamic and individualized experiences, and target recipients more accurately. Active media allow the integration of different human-centric systems into the era of system of systems. This new paradigm also overcomes the shortcomings of the existing paradigms for media consumption that still consider humans as information processors where media are considered as passive information objects processed by humans. However, media play more active roles in shaping our lives and in changing our behaviour and outlook, thus the process-oriented separation of passive objects and information processors is no longer valid when representing the interaction between media and humans. In this paper, e-marketing is used as an example of the application of active media. E-marketing environments are evolving into becoming more active and this could have a significant impact on the success of products and services. Applying the proposed framework on e-marketing communications will overcome the limitations of existing assessing methodologies by introducing a far wider and richer set of measures to describe, assess, and enhance the effectiveness of active media. The paper introduces an effectiveness framework based on a set of deliberate media effectiveness measures, and gives a sound rationale for choosing these measures.

2007,Using Signatures of Self-Organisation for Monitoring and Influencing Large Scale Autonomic Systems,"The complexity of large distributed systems makes the monitoring, necessary for self governance and autonomic functions, very problematic. Systems will be ordered hierarchically, consisting of systems of systems. Furthermore a system may be constructed from systems that are fundamentally different in topology from itself. This means that a monitoring strategy that is successful in one part of the system will not necessarily perform well in another system sector. This work considers a phase transition through four system topologies, observed to occur in the evolution of many self organising systems, starting at a regular circular 2D lattice to a scale-free phase. The best monitoring strategy for a scale-free system is considered with a form of acquaintance monitoring proposed. Thus when a system is observed to be acting in a scale-free manner the most suitable monitoring strategy can be deployed.

2015,An update on the framework for a junior level design course,"This paper presents a follow up look at a one semester, junior-level design course in electrical engineering at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. A summary of the class's objectives, content, system of systems-based projects and use in assessment are presented for the past three years. The course has evolved from that reported previously where it was centered on mobile robots, sensing and coordinated behavior to its current incarnation that focuses on the design of beacon-finding mobile robots. Beacon-finding robots are the result of the evolution of the course and desire to have students address projects with design and integration of multiple, independent systems. Students are tasked to build an autonomous mobile robot that can detect a Radio Frequency (RF) beacon, and ultimately use the robot's location and measurements from the beacon to determine the beacon's location without necessarily driving to it. The project blends several technical areas of electrical electrical engineering that include electromagnetics, RF, control theory, analog and digital electronics, signal processing, programming, and microcontrollers along with broader skills related to communication and design.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2015.7151970,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2019,"Efficiently Composing Validated Systems Integration Gateways for Dynamic, Diverse Data","Software systems typically evolve independently from one another. Integration opportunities and benefits only become apparent when new users or organizations adopt the system into the composition of a new system of systems solution, typically when new use cases are identified, or tangential needs arise. This leads to systems designed to use different data formats, network protocols, interaction patterns, and other disparities unable to natively communicate with each other. When integration does occur, it is often with custom one-off solutions that bridge the networks and systems in question. While integration may be plausible and even successful, these solutions tend to be costly, slow to produce, and tightly coupled to the specific systems or, even worse, specific versions of systems that they are connecting. In this paper we examine ROGER, a composable and dynamic gateway building framework that helps to address these integration costs and complexities. The ROGER framework abstracts away the common infrastructure needed in any system-bridging middleware, fosters reuse and capability sharing through a composition-driven plug-in framework, and allows for rapid gateway construction through a policy-centric composition structure. ROGER seeks to shorten integration gateway development time, reduce the amount of code creation required to build and deploy new gateways, as well as enable in-mission adaptation and extension of gateway capabilities as mission parameters and system awareness dictates. At the heart of this dynamism and adaptability in ROGER is the Information Flow Policy (IFP), a domain specific language that describes processing pipelines over incoming data streams. This paper presents the design of the compositional model and of the IFP that describes and enables the composition. We use a set of ROGER gateways as a dataset, along with a representative case study, in initial evaluations that show promising results regarding ROGER's ability to reduce development time and cost as well as minimize required skill sets.",10.1109/MILCOM47813.2019.9020714,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2020,DIARI: A Coordination Framework for Systems Design and Integration Management,"Systems design and integration are two phases of the system lifecycle that inherit a high degree of dependency from the interaction required from the organizations that need to come together to perform them. Current scaled agile frameworks assume the organizational structure to be a unified entity that delivers a system in form of a single output. In reality, a system is not a single output up to the moment it becomes operational. Until then it is an evolving aggregate and so are the organizations that jointly deliver it. In this paper, we demonstrate that this aggregate of organizations behaves as a System-of-Systems and that the current scaled agile frameworks are therefore not addressing the management of systems design and integration in an appropriate way. We propose a new coordination framework for managing systems design and integration - the DIARI Framework - that adapts to and scales with the complexity of the existing organizational structure.",10.1109/SysCon47679.2020.9275869,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,"Space Junk Aggregation, Neutralization, In-situ Transformation, and Orbital Recycling","Decades of human space activity has left a trail of space debris over various orbits surrounding the Earth. The abundance of space debris is both a threat and an untapped resource for further space exploration. This paper proposes an architecture for Space Junk Aggregation, Neutralization, In-situ Transformation and Orbital Recycling (Space JANITOR) for in-space recycling and re-purposing of space debris. The architecture consists of multiple Orbital Cleaning Drones (OCD) that would transport debris to a modular space station named Recycling Hub and Base (ReHAB), located in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). This station will retrieve and process debris, and facilitate on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (OSAM). This paper offers a multi-phase deployment plan for systematically achieving the full functionality of the Space JANITOR architecture, which may eventually evolve into a complete “space recycling industry”. Because of the numerous entities involved in each phase of deployment, the evolving architecture has been treated as a system of systems (SoS). This paper describes various aspects of the SoS and an overview of each deployment phase. The “stable intermediate form” approach has been used to define the evolution of this SoS, and the trade space for each phase has been summarized in terms of the resources, operations, policies and economics (ROPE) involved.",10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812659,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2019,System of System Composition Based on Decentralized Service-Oriented Architecture,"As society has progressed through periods of evolution and revolution, technology has played a key role as an enabler. In the same manner, mechanical machines of the 1800s drove the industrial revolution, now digitalized machines are driving another industrial revolution. Manufacturers are increasing the digital footprint on the factory floor. It is challenging to harness the vast amounts of data generated, stored, analyzed, archived, and returned. Data centralization has several well-known challenges, such as collection bottlenecks, secure retrieval, single point of failure, and data scheme fragility as data heterogeneity increases. This paper proposes a method of information distribution based on the principle of data at its source. It proposes that contextual data be used at runtime through the creation of dynamic queries that build compositions of different systems. Such system of systems (SoS) compositions handle the flow of data across its life cycle and present it as information to the initiating system. The proposal starts by creating a graph model of the Arrowhead framework. Then, building on the graph model, the query-based approach for specifying, validating, and forming the SoS is proposed. The proposed graph model allows for unambiguous description of systems and their interrelations, including security relations. The proposed composer operates on the edge computing hardware and gives the production floor the ability to extract information without impacting the overall operation of the factory.",10.1109/JSYST.2019.2894649,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2010,Towards an architecture for service-oriented process monitoring and control,"The initiative AESOP (ArchitecturE for Service-Oriented Process-Monitoring and - Control) envisions a Service-oriented Architecture approach for monitoring and control of Process Control applications (batch and continuous process). Large process industry systems are a complex (potentially very large) set of (frequently) multi-disciplinary, connected, heterogeneous systems that function as a complex system of which the components are themselves systems. The future “Perfect Plant” will be able to seamlessly collaborate and enable monitoring and control information flow in a cross-layer way. As such the different systems will be part of an SCADA/DCS ecosystem, where components can be dynamically added or removed and dynamic discovery enables the on-demand information combination and collaboration. All current and future systems will be able to share information in a timely and open manner, enabling an enterprise-wide system of systems that will dynamically evolve based on business needs. The SOA-based approach proposed by AESOP can, on one hand, simplify the integration of monitoring and control systems on application layer. On the other hand, the networking technologies that are already known to control engineers could also simplify the inclusion of or migration from existing solutions and integration of the next generation SCADA and DCS systems at network layer.",10.1109/IECON.2010.5675482,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5675482/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2023,LEO-PNT for Augmenting Europe's Space-based PNT Capabilities,"With GNSS as flagship, space-based PNT enables the single largest downstream space sector, worth about €150 billion annually and growing at the rate of 10 per cent per year [29]. The associated infrastructures (e.g. Galileo, GPS) are evolving and introducing new capabilities to meet more demanding needs, in a context of hybrid and system-of-systems PNT solutions. Meanwhile, PNT solutions which exploit signals from LEO (what is being called LEO-PNT) are emerging as a major trend of evolution for space-based PNT, backed by the benefits of multi-layer architectures and new industrial and business models in the Space sector (the so-called N ew Space). Many initiatives are now being taken worldwide, driven either by institutional or commercial stakes. Europe is taking part to the evolution of this landscape, supported by solid industrial grounds in New Space capabilities and PNT technologies, as well as by institutional initiatives. For instance, the proposal for a regulation of the European Union to establish IRIS2 (“Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnection & Security by Satellites”) refers to LEO-PNT as potential non-communication mission. In this context, this paper provides an overview of the current initiatives, and in particular, objectives, opportunities, trade-offs and possible solutions for LEO- PNT in the context of evolutions of European space-based infrastructures. The scope comprises an overview of the global LEO-PNT landscape, and in particular of the European one, for both purpose-built LEO- PNT and more opportunistic approaches such as the integration of PNT capabilities in existing or future satcom signals (e.g. 5G NTN). Possible use cases leveraging LEO-PNT are presented together with the associated design drivers and technologies, trade-offs and some examples of working points illustrating the differentiators of LEO-PNT in augmenting and complementing European GNSS capabilities. Technological enablers on the payload side as well as on the user side are addressed and discussed, based on ongoing studies and proof-of-concept developments, as well as incoming opportunities, such as the LEO-PNT In-Orbit Demonstrator under preparation.",10.1109/PLANS53410.2023.10139999,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2021,Aerospace Human Systems Integration,"This chapter focuses on the evolution of human‐centered design (HCD) in aerospace systems over the last forty years. Human factors and ergonomics first shifted from the study of physical and medical issues to cognitive issues circa the 1980s. The advent of computers brought with it the development of human–computer interaction (HCI), which then expanded into the field of digital interaction design and user experience (UX). We ended up with the concept of interactive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but because they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the early 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the point that complex system design and management found itself center stage, with the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups. Today, human systems integration (HSI) is no longer only a single‐agent problem, but a multi‐agent research field. Systems are systems of systems, considered as representations of people and machines. They are made of statically and dynamically articulated structures and functions. When they are at work, they are living organisms that generate emerging functions and structures that need to be considered in evolution (i.e. in their constant redesign). This chapter will more specifically focus on human factors such as human‐centered systemic representations, life‐critical systems, organizational issues, complexity management, modeling and simulation, flexibility, tangibility, and autonomy. The discussion will be based on several examples in civil aviation and air combat, as well as aerospace.",10.1002/9781119698821.ch7,,ieeeexplore; wiley

NASA has an interest in ab initio airspace system architectures that leapfrog today's evolutionary constraints enabling airspace operations of the future - 2035 and beyond. A clean-sheet approach to designing a future Airspace System leads to a myriad of possible architectures. Common concepts exist across all future alternatives. For example, each architecture must contain aircraft, aerodromes (both large and small), and airspace. The common concepts are captured in an ontology for a future Airspace System. The Airspace System ontology is composed of a collection of entities, properties and relationships representing the key system concepts. It separates the domain knowledge from the operational, thus enabling the development of architectural variations derived from a common language and understanding of the Airspace System.",10.1109/DASC.2017.8102091,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2019,A System Dynamics and Scenarios Framework for Architecting Product Design Goals for Changeability,"The design of changeable product architecture requires modeling the dynamic interaction between products and the sociotechnical sphere, in order to understand where changeability is needed. For example, a government approval of airport expansions will impact airline operations, and the design priorities of new airliners. The purpose of this paper is to develop an approach to determine design goals for a new product architecture in system of systems (SoS). These goals become dynamic, once linked to their underlying societal changes. The characteristic of the approach is to integrate system dynamics (SD) and scenario planning; thus, SD captures quantitative aspects of societal and product function dynamics, while scenarios provide a narrative explicating parameter choices, assumptions, and implications. In this paper, SD models include business and societal aspects to evaluate long-term profitability. Goal prioritization for a new product is obtained in the form of importance weights via global sensitivity analysis; these weights are highly dependent on external functions and risk attitude, and vary in time. A toy case study deals with modeling the household freezer's past evolution in an SoS to find evolving design priorities. The result is a positive evaluation of the method, using a recent Design for Changeability framework.",10.1109/JSYST.2018.2886565,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2023,Lunar Surface Power Architecture Concepts,"As part of the Artemis era of space exploration, space agencies will work together with industry partners to establish infrastructure and systems to enable sustained Lunar exploration and development. From the very first Lunar mission through the evolution of a full-fledged Lunar economy, power will persist as a foundational, enabling resource. Lockheed Martin is developing concepts using its technologies that address the complexities of a complete power architecture and satisfy the diversity of Lunar actors work towards building a sustained Lunar presence. Lunar power providers will establish a sustainable power infrastructure that enables continuous Lunar operations. That infrastructure needs to be architecturally flexible and operationally scalable from early missions to early microgrids to a mature long-term Lunar ecosystem with many diverse power consumers. This power value chain will comprise multiple technologies and operators within each class, from generation to storage, management, and distribution. Effectively managing a cohesive value chain at a system of systems level will be essential, as will adapting Lunar grid management to meet evolving power needs. Consumers and their requirements will be diverse, including science, resource production, cargo logistics, surface mobility, infrastructure emplacement, habitation, etc. The establishment of common interfaces, operating standards, and both legal and procedural norms will greatly aid in the interoperability and cohesion of the grid. This paper will detail Lockheed Martin's research and development, including the power required for major Lunar activities, the diverse locations where power delivery is required, and energy storage requirements to sustain long-duration and large-capacity operations. As an example of such trades, this paper will include a trade of cable power transfer versus several types of wireless power beaming for Lunar power delivery. It will delve into the trades regarding power levels and direct current (DC) versus alternating current (AC) for the Lunar power grid. It will outline best use of power generation methods depending on location on the Lunar surface. For example, microgrids based on solar power generation are more cost and mass efficient at the south pole, while energy storage becomes a microgrid design driver as operations move into lower latitudes. Lockheed Martin has conducted research on vertical solar array technology, the development of large-capacity, long-duration energy storage, fission surface power, power beaming, hardened electronics, cabling, and novel in-situ storage solutions. Power availability is a foundational enabler of Lunar activities, and its lack of supply on the Lunar surface is a major barrier to entry. A cohesive, evolvable, interoperable global Lunar power grid will lower this and other barriers of entry to Lunar exploration so that a greater diversity of commercial and international partners can participate in the emerging Lunar economy.",10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115621,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2012,Basic genetic-algorithm-neural-network (GANN) pattern with a self-organizing security example,"The anti-system adversarial community is characterized as a self-organizing system-of-systems, noted collectively for its leadership in rapid evolution and innovative advancement; widening the gap between security cost and security losses. It appears that system security strategy cannot hope to even achieve parity without a comparable self-organizing strategy. Toward that end a project is underway to catalog re-usable patterns of self-organizing security of many kinds, principally found in natural systems, but also seen in recent computational approaches. One class of pattern of special interest involves discovery of previously unseen threats and attacks. In general this class of pattern has aspects of learning, innovation, and evolution as capability objectives. The genetic algorithm is one such pattern. Another such pattern is seen in artificial neural networks. Combining the two into a Genetic Algorithm augmented Neural Network, often called GANN, has considerable recent history in the literature. Not many of these are directly related to security applications. Some security-application work shows GANNs employed for feature selection provide enhanced learning performance and accuracy, and avoidance of local minimum traps. This paper adds the GANN pattern to the self-organizing security pattern catalog, and applies the pattern to a self-organizing security application under development.",10.1109/CCST.2012.6393578,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,Upgrading Approach for MaaS Level 4 Using UAF,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is being commercialized and studied worldwide to overcome social issues such as transportation and environmental problems. To implement MaaS, solutions provided by different administrative, operational, and independent enterprises in different industry sectors need to be combined and integrated as a single service according to their objectives and needs. The ultimate goal of MaaS is the integration of social goals (i.e., involving regional policy; also called Level 4). To achieve this, the entirety of the systems constituting MaaS must be viewed as a System of Systems (SoS), and various stakeholders in different industry areas must work closely together based on policy objectives. In this paper, we propose an ""upgrading approach"" to enable the gradual evolution of SoS based on its architecture to achieve MaaS Level 4. The case study is called ""Snow Country MaaS,"" and it considers the heavy snowfall area of Japan. Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) is used for the architecture description. The SoS architecture of Snow Country MaaS is described by an iterative approach based on the strategic, operational, service, and resource perspectives defined in UAF. By applying the upgrading approach to the hierarchical perspectives defined in UAF, it is possible to discuss and determine policies for the evolution and criteria for the entire SoS from multiple perspectives.",10.1109/ISSE54508.2022.10005337,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2019,Segment Routing Based Traffic Scheduling for the Software-Defined Airborne Backbone Network,"With the ubiquitous use of networking technologies in the military domain, network-centric warfare, which aims at improving the system of systems (SoS) capability, is a no-way-back trend of military development. Recently, it has become increasingly important to construct an airborne backbone network (ABN) to maintain coverage and provide reach-back to military units because the terrestrial networks cannot be flexibly deployed and have poor survivability. Given the advantages of software-defined networking (SDN), a software-defined airborne backbone network architecture (SD-ABN) is proposed for the ABN to ensure network flexibility, openness, interoperability, and evolvability. To meet the challenges of traffic management in SD-ABN, segment routing (SR) is applied with some practical modifications for the SD-ABN. Moreover, a network traffic scheduling algorithm termed MRP-TS is designed based on SD-ABN to improve the transmission reliability and bandwidth utilization by balancing network traffic to multiple reliable transmission paths. Relevant theories have been proposed and proved to illustrate the correctness of the algorithm. The network simulation experiments have been conducted using the network simulator EXata 5.1, and the simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposals.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930229,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2005,Ontology-based active requirements engineering framework,"Software-intensive systems are systems of systems that rely on complex interdependencies among themselves as well as with their operational environment to satisfy the required behavior. As we integrate such systems to create information infrastructures that are critical to the quality of our lives and the businesses they support, the need to effectively predict, control and evolve their behavior is ever increasing. To deal with their complexity, an important first step is to understand and model software-intensive systems, their environments and the interdependencies among them at different levels of abstractions from multiple dimensions. In this paper, we present an ontology-based active requirements engineering (Onto-ActRE) framework that adopts a mixed-initiative approach to elicit, represent and analyze the diversity of factors associated with software-intensive systems. The Onto-ActRE framework integrates various RE modeling techniques with complementary semantics in a unifying ontological engineering process.

2008,Toward an adaptive data distribution service for dynamic large-scale network-centric operation and warfare (NCOW) systems,"To achieve the goal of information dominance, the DoD has adopted the doctrine of net-centric operations and warfare (NCOW). The global information grid (GIG), future combat system (FCS), C2 constellation, and FORCEnet are examples of net-centric operations where multiple systems-of-systems integrate thousands of platforms, sensors, decision nodes, weapons, and warfighters through heterogeneous wire-line and wireless networks. NCOW provides superior collection, fusion, analysis, and use of information to help the DoD exploit information superiority and achieve strategic and tactical goals. Standard-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) middleware, such as the object management group (OMG) 's data distribution service (DDS), is a key enabling technology to build and evolve large-scale and long-lived distributed real-time and embedded NCOW systems. DDS is particularly relevant since it is the only standards-based pub/sub middleware that can satisfy the stringent quality-of service (QoS) requirements for a wide variety of tactical net-centric applications. The current OMG DDS specification, however, does not define services that (1) enable large-scale applications to execute in highly dynamic wide-area network environments, where information producers and consumers join and leave the information exchange and (2) rigorously maintain the necessary QoS required by NCOW systems. This paper provides three contributions to enabling dynamic NCOW applications to utilize standard-based pub/sub middleware effectively. First, it investigates and surveys key challenges in building dynamic NCOW applications, using DDS as an example. Second, it examines existing DDS standards and DDS implementations and identifies their pros and cons in the context of NCOW. Finally, we propose an adaptive discovery service framework that enables the application of DDS in large-scale and highly dynamic data-critical NCOW systems over diverse operating environments.",10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753364,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2018,A Reactive and Model-Based Approach for Developing Internet-of-Things Systems,"Software has a longstanding association with a state of crisis considering its success rate. The explosion of Internet-connected devices – Internet-of-Things – adds to the complexity of software systems. The particular characteristics of these systems, such as its large-scale and heterogeneity, pose increasingly new challenges. Model-based approaches have been widely used as a mechanism to abstract low-level programming details and processes. By using such approaches, and leveraging concepts as reactive design, visual notations, and live programming, we believe to be able to reduce the complexity of creating, operate/monitor and evolve such systems. The main objective of this Ph.D. is to delve into the software engineering practices for developing IoT systems and systems of systems, exploiting models as a suitable abstraction, expecting to reduce the complexity of managing most of the software development lifecycle that targets IoT systems and to develop the prototype that will aid on the validation of such approach.",10.1109/QUATIC.2018.00049,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8590202/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2021,Agile Systems Engineering in Complex Scenarios,"The successful development of complex Systems of Systems (SoS) is highly dependent on quality of the requirements engineering (RE). The goal is to get “good” requirements in the beginning and to keep them stable until the delivery of the final product. In reality, this is wishful thinking. In complex real-world scenarios the requirements are never fully understood and never stable - they evolve during the development process. This is a severe issue for complex and highly elaborated systems engineering processes. Usually, the projects get out of control due to the change requests or do not deliver a result fitting the current need of the customer. Elaborated innovation management, marketing and customer relation processes are used to understand the need of the customer (market pull) and the new technical possibilities (technology push). The design and implementation of such innovation management processes is complex in itself and well researched. This paper extends the state-of-the-art with a focus on the interfacing between the systems engineering process (for the product development) and the innovation management process (for the ideation and innovation creation). We propose a parallel, interlinked execution of both processes instead of the over-the-fence practice where an innovation idea is handed over to product development at a certain point of time. A continuous interaction of both processes with agile management methods reduces the risk of getting the wrong product. Instead of using wrong or outdated information in the product development due to the missing updates from innovation management, a continuous linking and exchange mechanism with the systems engineering project is proposed. Interlinking these two complex processes is addressed with scenario-based methods and a process similar to BizDevOps. The full paper will evaluate the concepts based on a complex eMobility case study.",10.1109/IDAACS53288.2021.9661020,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2021,Applying SoSE in Healthcare: the case for a soft systems methodology approach to Digital-first Primary Care,"Systems of Systems (SoS) and the challenges they present are very complex. The National Health Service (NHS) is one such complex system within the UK that is facing a number of challenges. These range from an ageing and growing population with evolving healthcare needs, to increasing costs and reliance on private services. As such, a number of programmes and models have been introduced to transform care. Digital-first Primary Care (DfPC) is one such example. DfPC allows for faster and improved patient access to primary care by providing the choice of telephone and online consultations via the patient's GP practice or digital GP providers. The DfPC model has been at the forefront of primary care during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, hence the need for current research to evaluate its impact, suitability, and value in a post-pandemic world. Whilst this area is of high interest in the research community, there exists a gap in the method of analysis used. In this paper, the case for a soft systems methodology approach to DfPC is put forward.

2012,Integrative Research: The EuroGEOSS Experience,"The implementation of the INSPIRE Directive in Europe and similar efforts around the globe to develop spatial data infrastructures and global systems of systems have been largely focusing on the adoption of agreed technologies, standards, and specifications to address the interoperability challenge. However, addressing the key scientific challenges of humanity in the 21st century requires a more comprehensive integrative research effort, which in turn may pose more complex requirements on the systems to be integrated, and increase the number of arrangements required to support them. This paper analyses the main challenges related to integrative interoperability, such as mutual understanding of requirements and methods, theoretical underpinning, and tacit knowledge. To illustrate our contribution to the integrative research, the paper proposes the flexible approach to interoperability, based on mediation and brokering, that has been implemented by the EuroGEOSS research project. It also demonstrates that this approach allows scientific and non-scientific stakeholders to overcome the increased complexity of the integration effort mentioned above and charts the trajectory for the evolution of current spatial data infrastructures.",10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2190382,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2010,A Complex Systems Modelling Approach for Decentralised Simulation of Electrical Microgrids,"The structure and behaviour of Electrical Grids share many of the properties of Complex Computer Systems, with microgrids and other decentralised electrical systems attached to them, so they can be interpreted as Systems of Systems. Furthermore, the evolution of future electrical systems will bring a higher degree of decentralisation, especially concerning production and control. To deal with this paradigm change, new models and tools are necessary. In this paper a model of an electrical microgrid is presented. The approach used in the development of the model is agent-based in combination with system dynamics modelling. By mixing these approaches the different entities of the electrical system (production, demand, storage, etc.) have been represented. Through the individual behaviour of the agents it is possible to reproduce the complex behaviour of the system as a whole. This can produce expected and unexpected emergent effects on the interconnected system that are analysed through the simulation. A case study is presented to analyse the capabilities of such models. The example shows the simulation of an integrated microgrid system, where different components such as renewable energy sources and storage have been implemented. The simulation results of this case study are discussed.",10.1109/ICECCS.2010.1,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5628594/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2012,MCFlow: A Real-Time Multi-core Aware Middleware for Dependent Task Graphs,"Driven by the evolution of modern computer architectures from uni-processor to multi-core platforms, there is an increasing need to provide light-weight, efficient, and predictable support for fine-grained parallel and distributed execution of soft real-time tasks with end-to-end timing constraints, modeled as directed a cyclic graphs whose edges capture dependences among their subtasks. At the same time, there is a need to support state of the art programming models such as distributed components, whose ability to encapsulate functionality and allow context-specific optimizations is essential to manage the increasing complexity of modern distributed real-time and embedded systems and systems-of-systems. Real-time distributed middleware such as RT-CORBA has not kept pace with these developments, and a new generation of middleware is needed that can map these dependent subtask graphs onto distributed hosts with multi-core architectures, efficiently and within a simple, lightweight, and intuitive component programming model. To overcome these limitations, we have designed and implemented MC Flow, a novel distributed real-time component middleware for dependent subtask graphs running on multi-core platforms. MC Flow provides three new contributions to the state of the art in real-time component middleware: (1) a very lightweight component model that facilitates system integration and deployment through automatic code generation at compile time from a deployment plan specification, (2) transparent optimization of inter-component communication, and (3) the use of interface polymorphism to separate functional correctness from data copying and other performance constraints so that they can be configured and enforced independently but in a type-safe manner. Empirical evaluations of our approach in comparison to the widely used TAO real-time middleware show that MC Flow performs comparably to TAO when only one core is used and outperforms TAO when multiple cores are involved.",10.1109/RTCSA.2012.30,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2017,Approach towards achieving an interoperable C4ISR infrastructure,"Coalition or Joint Forces operations involving multiple countries utilizing Net-Centric Warfare (NCW) is the need and trend of the modern battlefield. These heterogeneous forces have heterogeneous equipments adhering to their country's standards and specifications. This pushes for systems-of-systems interoperability to allow multinational manning of platforms operating within a combined command structure. The next generation coalition environment requires sharing of equipment, data and resources using an interoperable command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) infrastructure. The evolution of military sensor technologies at an unprecedented rate requires the use of various existing sub-systems, Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) as well as Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors due their inherent advantages. The data from these entities needs to be exchanged flawlessly so that the best Common Operational Picture (COP) of the battlefield can be presented to the command structure for taking the correct action. In this paper, we present an approach towards achieving programmatic, constructional and operational interoperabilty for NATO C4ISR infrastructure using the NATO Generic Vehicle Architecture (NGVA), Robotics and Autonomous Systems Ground (RAS-G) Interoperability Profiles (IOPs) and Multilateral Interoperability Programme (MIP) standards to support the future coalition battlefields. It allows the NATO military land system vehicles to be able to exchange control and command with the Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) in turn, allow the exchange of data with higher echelons like command centres without any dependencies and bottlenecks.",10.1109/MILTECHS.2017.7988788,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2013,Incorporating Architecture Patterns in a SoS Optimization Framework,"Creation and management of large complex systems of systems (SoS) can be a daunting task for even the most experienced engineers. Architecting these systems requires considerable domain expertise and next generation tools to seamlessly link requirements elicitation, through to modeling and simulation, and finally through to implementation. The resulting SoS can be so complex that it is virtually impossible for a single person to understand all its interactions. An important aid to this process is the use of architecture patterns that provide blueprints for proven elements of a system that can be incorporated into the evolution of a system or service. This paper describes a novel approach in validating architecture patterns during the early phases of service or product design and development. We propose an architecture optimization method called Concise Modeling to be used in conjunction with architecture patterns to expedite SoS architecture exploration and analysis.",10.1109/SMC.2013.297,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,A Quantum-Like Model for Predicting Human Decisions in the Entangled Social Systems,"Human-centered systems of systems, such as social networks, the Internet of Things, or healthcare systems are growingly becoming significant facets of modern life. Realistic models of human behavior in such systems play an essential role in their accurate modeling and prediction. Nevertheless, human behavior under uncertainty often violates the predictions by the conventional probabilistic models. Recently, quantum-like decision theories have shown a considerable potential to explain the contradictions in human behavior by applying quantum probabilities. But providing a quantum-like decision theory that could predict rather than describe the current state of human behavior is still one of the unsolved challenges. The fundamental contribution of this work is introducing the concept of entanglement from quantum information theory to Bayesian networks (BNs). This concept leads to an entangled quantum-like BN (QBN), in which each human is a part of the entire society. Accordingly, society’s effect on the dynamic evolution of the decision-making process, which is less often considered in decision theories, is modeled by entanglement measures. To reach this aim, we introduce a quantum-like witness and find the relationship between this witness and the famous concurrence entanglement measure. The proposed predictive entangled QBN (PEQBN) is evaluated on 22 experimental tasks. Results confirm that PEQBN provides more realistic predictions of human decisions under uncertainty when compared with classical BNs and three recent quantum-like approaches.",10.1109/TCYB.2021.3134688,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2023,Toward Conceptual Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems Projects Focusing on the Composition of Legacy Systems,"The increase in connectivity and the continued need to evolve existing systems impose on system engineers the reality of dealing with System of Systems (SoS) concept in practice. The composition of legacy systems presents significant challenges, especially when a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is involved. Due to the complexity of the interactions between CPS computational solutions and the physical environment, added to the operational independence of CPS as constituent system, emergent behaviors might unpredictably emerge when the CPS and other system run to collaborate being difficult to control. The purpose of this article is to present the Discovery and Requirement Canvas method and its contributions on highlighting emergent behavior. Introduced in the context of EMBED-SoSE approach, the method supports the process of designing a CPSoS in the early phases of a project, when the stakeholders’ needs, constraints, and alternatives must be analyzed in terms of the integration possibilities of existing constituent systems. An experimental study conducted with 22 senior professionals from the software and aerospace industries validates the practicability of the method Discovery & Requirement Canvas demonstrating its efficacy.

2013,Implementation of avionics standards for time based air traffic management,"As methods of air traffic management evolve using time as a foundational tool, standards must be developed today to ensure adequate performance of individual navigation systems that will form the backbone of tomorrow's airspace system. With respect to acceptable crossing time errors in a trajectory based operations environment, initial parameters for accuracy have been published and additional requirements have been proposed to serve as minimum aviation performance standards. These standards will influence the development of algorithms that drive future flight management systems, and it is important to fully understand their implications, including the potential for unintended consequences in a system of systems. Following a brief history of separation standards development, data sets from several flight tests and simulations are reviewed for use in assessing the safety and achievability of previous proposals for time of arrival control accuracy standards. Subsequently, a comprehensive standards framework for an evidence-based categorical standard is introduced.

2008,Application of Satellite Sensor Data and Models for Energy Management,"Effective, environmentally sound development, production, and delivery of energy depend on Earth monitoring information. Satellite remote sensing data and products provide unique, objective information that has the additional advantage of yielding global, homogeneous, and repetitive coverage. Satellite remote sensing data and products have been used extensively in parts of the energy sector for applications ranging from climatology to identification of solar and wind energy sources, yet there is significant potential to expand energy applications. This paper discusses the key energy sector organizations and decision-support tools with the greatest potential to benefit from new applications of satellite remote sensing data, identifies relevant remote sensing data and products with a focus on NASA Earth science resources, and provides examples that show the added value of the Earth observations. These examples come from the application of NASA data to solar energy information needs.

With ever more complex systems being developed and changed there has been an increasing reliance on simulation as a vital part of the design process. There is also a growing need for simulation integration and co-simulation in order to analyse the complex interactions between system components. To this end we propose that the Internet of Simulation (IoS) as an extension of IoT can be used to meet these needs. The IoS allows for multiple heterogeneous simulations to be integrated together for co-simulation. It's effect on the engineer process is to facilitate agile practices without sacrificing rigour.

2022,Identifying AI Opportunities in Donor Kidney Acceptance: Incremental Hierarchical Systems Engineering Approach,"The current organ placement process for transplantation is an evolving system of systems with emergent behavior. This highly integrated complex system consists of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), Transplant Centers (TXC), patients, and their interactions. The number of waitlisted kidney candidates is nearly five times the available supply. Unfortunately, over twenty percent of donated deceased donor kidneys (supply) are discarded due to issues with kidney quality. While some of this discard is medically necessary, some represent a lost opportunity. One approach is to develop a decision support system to identify the right candidate for the right donor at the right time and then communicate that analysis to various stakeholders in different locations over time. This paper uses an incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach to capture the current kidney allocation systems architecture and identify opportunities for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision support system to reduce kidney discard. The incremental hierarchical (top to bottom) approach was combined with model-based system engineering (MBSE) to aid in eliciting stakeholders’ needs, behaviors, boundaries, and interactions. This approach led to a structured development process for the attractor “reducing kidney discard” and facilitated systematically documenting the opportunity space. Stakeholders reviewed proposed AI decision support systems, ensuring that decision points with more significant opportunities were addressed. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach is justified with a data-driven deep learning TXC decision support system validated by transplant surgeons. Future work will include developing data-driven models for all stakeholders using current data incorporating the most recent kidney allocation policy changes.",10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773875,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Given that the Uplink Array is a new technology, the focus has always been on its feasibility and phase calibration techniques, which by itself is quite a challenge. It would be interesting to examine, however, what else could be accomplished by the uplink array capability other than the emergency support to a troubled spacecraft in deep space. Although the uplink array calibration and demonstration for proof of concept is still underway at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), knowledge of various potential meaningful application scenarios as well as operation concepts of uplink array is equally important to better understand and fine tune the high level architectural requirements of this big evolving system of systems. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to discuss a few application scenarios and the corresponding operation concepts, such as lunar positioning system, high EIRP uplink and the synergies with solar system radar, and high power RF beams",10.1109/AERO.2006.1655833,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,Airbus flexible payload perspective,"The satellite industry is evolving at a rate not seen in its previous 60 year history. The industry is attracting investment from new players resulting in billions of euros being invested in new space mega constellations. This massive investment in the space ecosystem is driving innovation in flexible payload technologies across LEO, MEO and GEO, supporting commercial governmental and military satellite applications. Airbus Defence and Space has long been a leading player and first to market innovator in the domain of flexible payloads building fully digitally beamformed flexible payloads for GEO mobile applications for Inmarsat and Thuraya, The Eutelsat Quantum fully flexible software defined satellite, and more recently the Onesat product for Inmarsat, Intelsat, Optus and JSAT.

Indeed Airbus provided huge contributions ranging from full build launch and operating services, to payload subsystem provision for all major European Military SATCOM systems. Airbus experience in flexible payloads is not limited to GEO orbit, Airbus has worked closely with Oneweb and produced and launched to date many hundreds of LEO satellites having highly flexible payloads, leveraging novel new space methodologies and automated final assembly (FAL) techniques. Despite the huge success and achievements to date, innovation at Airbus never stands still. With this in mind Airbus has devoted millions of Euros of research and development funding with backing from ESA, ARTES and national institutions to study and shape the next generation of satellite communications. We have studied LEO MEO and GEO orbits, the projected use cases of each orbit, the required technology roadmaps and means to interconnect these orbits resulting in a system of systems able to leverage the pros of a given orbit, without being constrained by its cons.

In complex, evolving, and dynamic environments, the human operator’s ability to efficiently observe, orient, decide, and act is imperative. However, the operator’s performance can be degraded during changes in UAS custody between ABMs and pilots, which significantly increases operator cognitive workload beyond that typically seen in previous missions. Unfortunately, C2 technology development often places a heavy focus on automation and hardware, leaving the human operator underrepresented to the detriment human-automation interactions. Currently, Digital Engineering and Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools are rapidly being adopted in system development, integration, and management to support the complex development effort necessary to integrate these systems. The current research integrated human considerations in MBSE tools to analyze human-automation teaming during the development process. The method supports representation of the automation assistance and human operators during a modeled mission simulation in a pair of specialized activity diagrams referred to as the Mission Actor Diagram and the OODA2 Activity Diagram, permitting analysis of errors and bottlenecks during operation.

2021,Applying model-based Co-Simulation on modular Production Units in Complex Automation Systems,"Contemporary manufacturing systems face major challenges driven by the ongoing integration of intelligent manufacturing components, mainly caused by the emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the interplay of those Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) itself forms a System of Systems (SoS), engineering such a system becomes a difficult task. This is mainly attributed to the evolutionary development of its independently operating components, which results in some kind of unpredictable and often undesirable behavior. Considering this from a developer’s perspective, it is important to investigate the system’s behaviors before its actual implementation. However, as methods applied in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) have proven to be a major technology driver when it comes to developing the architecture of these industrial systems, their simulation is still not standardized. Thus, this paper introduces an Industry 4.0 specific tool-chain enabling the co-simulation of components within any developed industrial system architecture. This allows the investigation of varying industrial CPS and their interplay during run-time with the goal to detect undesired emergent behaviors. By doing so, the model is developed regarding the specifications of the Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), while Mosaik is the tool of choice for creating the Co-Simulation environment.

A key challenge is the design for volatility and evolution experienced when those systems are deployed in more than one environment as well as for a substantial time period. The work presented here describes a proposed federated System of Systems (SoS) engineering approach for creating ubiquitous systems based on service-oriented principles. Service orientation is becoming more common for SoS implementation as it supports operational independence, managerial independence, and geographic distribution of constituent systems. However, in a virtual SoS, there is no central management authority and centrally agreed purpose, making interface standardization and integration of capabilities a difficult task.

2014,Survival management by living systems,"To survive that is `to eat and not to be eaten'. A living system is part of food chains within an ecoexotope of survival (EXO) that it shares with other systems; `soon or late it is impossible not to be eaten.' Their modularity allows living systems a local and a global recycling of matter and energy. The agoantagonistic relations balance leads soon or late to predators disappearance with a reduction of biodiversity. The functioning is associated with scaling independent, local and global, qualitative characteristics (gauge invariance) and quantitative power laws. The merging into `Associations for the Reciprocal and Mutual Sharing of Advantages and DisAdvantages' (ARMSADA) allows a new biodiversity emergence. More and more independent of the previous local situations, in their new global level of organization, the local actors become mutually integrated into a new global Whole. And reversely (systemic constructal law), the Whole is more and more integrating local parceners. The evolution of living systems is seen as cooperative, the law of the strongest is not-at-all the best! The only way to escape from struggles is to enter into an ARMSADA. A lichen -both an organism and an ecosystem-, a cell, are ARMSADAs that emerged when the partners lose simultaneously the capacity to kill the other ones. In the new Whole, all that is an advantage for a partner is a disadvantage for other ones. They are fused `for the best and for the worst'. Benefits are only for the Whole which expresses new abilities. The cell emerged from Monera with the help of a RNA virus. In their new endophysiotope (ENDO), the parceners are dependent from each others. Through the iteration process of new ARMSADAs' emerging, the new more and more complex system-of-systems is more and more independent from its EXO. There are never advantages without dis-advantages! To survive that is to turn disadvantages into advantages and to avoid advantages turning to disadvantages. The cell apoptosis results from the systemic dys-functioning of its ARMSADA, the death of a partner leads to the cell death. Each partner can survive only if the other ones survive first. Cancer is a breaking of the cell's ARMSADA. Cells that should have to die, due to dangers, due to escapes of internal viruses, do not.

The increasing complexity of automated processes encourages monitoring industrial or organizational operation facilities’ cyber-physical systems (sensors and actuators) and informatics systems to guarantee their correct functioning. However, dealing with heterogeneous systems and devices provided by manufacturers with different programming interfaces might hinder this task.The Synoptics of Things (SoT) framework aims to facilitate Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) development, as user or operator interface windows to an organization’s technological landscape. The proposed models enable the creation and management of the life cycle of customized operator’s synoptic interfaces used for introspection or interactions with cyber-physical systems (CPS) or informatics systems (ISystems) elements.In this paper, we present and discuss the adoption of SoT to the SINCRO project (National System for Velocity Control) as a case study to show the openness and value of the framework.

2005,Assured Counter-Terrorism Information Sharing Using Attribute Based Information Security (ABIS),"For counter-terrorism information sharing, just like for many other government and military operations in the post-9/11 world, the traditional mindset of ""need to know"" is being overtaken by the ""need to share"" among dynamic communities of interests (COIs). The problem with current IT environments and security mechanisms forces equal sharing of all information at the lowest common denominator, often requiring setting up new physical networks to protect the information boundaries, which is often time-consuming, costly, and not interoperable. The recent technology evolution towards service oriented architectures (SOAs) helps establish a loosely coupled, interoperable ""system of systems"" platform, however they also bring about their own security challenges. This paper outlines the inefficiency of conventional network boundary based, protection-oriented information security mechanisms as well as the new security challenges for the emerging SOA technologies, and proposes attribute based information security (ABIS) as a new approach for addressing these challenges. Center to this new approach is a generic attribute based access control (ABAC) model, which is based on subject, object, and environment attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs. To realize the potentials of the ABAC model, the paper introduces a high level ABIS reference architecture, which reflects the proposed technical approaches to achieve an attribute-centric security methodology: First of all, to establish such an environment that facilitates the seamless flow of information between collaborating parties, the capability to provision and manage attributes for subjects and resources needs to be established. Secondly, attribute-binding mechanisms need to be in place to support the integrity and data assurance of the information objects. Next, the architecture should provide identification, authentication and authorization mechanisms based on the attributes. Building upon these tasks will lead to the establishment of ""trusted information domains"" within a shared network infrastructure, providing the ability to establish logical COIs seamlessly, created as needed or modified as policy dictates. The paper explores the possibilities of extending the ABAC model to across trust domains, allowing multiple levels of policy enforcement and policy federation",10.1109/AERO.2005.1559621,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,Development of a multi-purpose SDR payload for the HYPSO-2 satellite,"Recent developments in flexible Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms provide researchers with a framework for small satellite missions that combine several parallel objectives. A part of the mission for the HYPer-spectral Smallsat for ocean Observation (HYPSO-2) satellite from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is to provide a responsive and agile service to the users where the on-board application software can be updated in flight. The radio-oriented part of the mission objectives spans radio frequency interference measurements and channel characterization in the selected frequency band — 400 MHz UHF – as well as a demonstration of communication services between the satellite and terrestrial sensor nodes and robotic agents. Energy-constrained sensor nodes in remote areas, such as the Arctic, is one of the application scenarios that would benefit from a tailored communication service. Even with services from emerging mega-constellations, traditional satellite communication systems, and new Internet of Things (IoT) over satellite services, there is a service gap for long-range-long-endurance robotic agents and Arctic sensor networks. Therefore, a better understanding of the radio frequency environment, including in-orbit interference as well as channel characteristics, can aid the design of responsive and robust communication links connecting individual assets of a larger System-of-Systems. Instead of just focusing on average spectrum interference levels, the frequency monitoring software enables the estimation of the interference dispersion and temporal variability. The HYPSO-2 is an evolution of the HYPSO-1 satellite, thus leveraging an already implemented mission software framework. Parts of the SDR payload have been tested on-board another satellite, and the in-orbit results from those measurements will be used as input for the next generation of the radio interference application.",10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843447,,ieeeexplore; scopus

2017,"Joint 5th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and 11th Workshop on Distributed Software Development, Software Ecosystems and Systems-of-","Summary for only given, as follows. Systems-of-Systems (SoS) have become increasingly complex and frequently used in highly distributed, dynamic, and even open environments. SoS refer to evolving software systems, where constituent systems (themselves systems in their own right) work cooperatively to fulfill specific, complex missions, facing software engineering researchers and practitioners with substantial challenges. In parallel, Software Ecosystem (SECO) has also become an important research topic in software engineering, addressing social issues along with technical aspects of software development. SoS and SECO are closely related, also naturally distributed so as the distribution of development teams, along with the inherent difficulties of coordination and communication. In this scenario, Distributed Software Development (DSD) deals with distributed resources to reduce cost and reach new IT markets. Inherent problems and challenges of software engineering are then amplified and become more critical when those three topics need to be analyzed together. This special edition of SESoS/WDES 2017 will provide researchers and practitioners with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences, analyze research and development issues, discuss promising solutions, and propose theoretical foundations for development and evolution of complex systems, inspiring visions for the future of software engineering for SoS, SECO, and DSD and paving the way for a more structured community effort.",10.1109/JSOS.2017.22,,ieeeexplore

2010,Cyber–Physical Systems: Close Encounters Between Two Parallel Worlds [Point of View],"Technology, science, and engineering continue to redefine physical world capabilities. Take mobility of humans, for example. In the 20th century, transportation systems moved us to unimaginable distances, speeds on earth and made us set foot on the Moon. Star Trek popularized teleportation, a fictitious technology that instantly allows us to ""go where no person has gone before."" Before end of the century, Internet and wireless networking helped to create the parallel ""cyber world,"" virtually ""teleporting"" us great distances to interact with remote objects, people, and places. In the new millennium, our restless society's need for such ground-breaking capabilities in time and space has never been greater. Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a promising new class of systems that deeply embed cyber capabilities in the physical world, either on humans, infrastructure or platforms, to transform interactions with the physical world. Advances in the cyber world such as communications, networking, sensing, computing, storage, and control, as well as in the physical world such as materials, hardware, and renewable ""green"" fuels, are all rapidly converging to realize this class of highly collaborative computational systems that are reliant on sensors and actuators to monitor and effect change.Tomorrow's CPS is expected to enrich cyber-physical interactions by intimately coupling assets and dynamics of the physical and engineered systems with the computing and communications of cyber systems, at grand scales and depths from nanosystems to geographically dispersed systems-of-systems.

Regarding target’s attacking as the essential impetus to the SoS response and structural adjustment, the positive and negative effects of target stream on synchronization are discussed, by analyzing the macro characteristics on element attributes and topology evolution under the condition of SoS combat. Integrated with combat ring theory and coupled oscillator model, the mechanism and characterization of SoS phase synchronization are studied. Moreover, the updating method of node phase iteration is presented. Compared with the static-synchronization, the simulation results exhibit obvious differences among the dynamic-synchronization possessing special dynamic characteristic, and the oscillation pattern and synchronization ability. © 2022, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

2022,A SOA-Based Engineering Process Model for the Life Cycle Management of System-of-Systems in Industry 4.0,"The evolution of industrial digitalisation has accelerated in recent years with the availability of hyperconnectivity, low-cost miniaturised electronic components, edge computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. More generally, with these key enablers, the concept of a system of systems (SoS) is becoming a reality in the industry domain. However, due to its complexity, the engineering process model adopted to design, develop, and manage IoT and SoS-based solutions for industry digitalisation is inadequate, inefficient, and frequently unable to manage the digitalisation solution’s entire life cycle. To address these limitations, we propose the Arrowhead Engineering Process (Arrowhead-EP) model and the Value Chain Engineering Process Map (VCEP-map), which explicitly reveal the interactions and dynamics of the engineering processes adopted by multistakeholder use cases in the industry domain. We decomposed and remodeled the engineering process to cover the complete life cycle of an industrial SoS, and we introduced a service-oriented solution intended to efficiently, flexibly, and effectively manage the three assets addressed by RAMI 4.0. The Arrowhead-EP model complemented by the VCEP-map fills the gaps identified in our literature-based analysis and satisfies the requirements of the life cycle management of a typical use case in the Industry 4.0 domain. In this regard, a specific example is used to illustrate the advantages of adopting the proposed engineering solution in a real multistakeholder use case. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/app12157730,,scopus; webofscience
2021,MBSE delivers significant return on investment in evolutionary development of complex SoS,"The Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) is a rapidly evolving combat system of systems (SoS) product family. Managing the annual baseline updates requires processing thousands of baseline change requests, then coordinating and verifying their implementation. The complexity of this effort, which involves well over ten million source-lines-of-code (SLOC) as well as Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and military-unique hardware, is compounded by being deployed in ten variants. After a feasibility study in 2010 the SWFTS systems engineering and integration program started a transition from traditional requirements database and document-centric systems engineering (DCSE) to a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) process. At that time there was little solid evidence in the literature for a positive Return on Investment (ROI) for moving from DCSE to MBSE. Applying MBSE to this program has resulted in measurable monetary and operational benefits. We 1) summarize the DCSE to MBSE transition, 2) describe the accomplishments and observations to date, 3) define the metrics collected, and 4) quantify the achieved ROI. Background on the systems engineering and integration (SE&I) process and an apples-to-apples comparison of SE quality and efficiency are provided. The raw SE&I efficiencies of the DCSE and MBSE approaches are documented, along with conclusions showing that the MBSE approach delivers a positive ROI through higher quality SE products at significantly less cost-per-change, enables managing more baselines and SoS complexity using constant resources, and reduces the cost of the downstream integration effort. © 2021 Lockheed Martin Corporation.

2022,A System-of-Systems Framework of Data Analytics to Support Strategic Decision-Making in the Construction Industry,"The construction industry is complex and dynamic by nature. Such dynamic nature of the industry requires construction companies to continuously monitor and track a variety of external factors, ranging from economic data to safety-related measures, in order to respond timely to the changing business climate and thus make effective strategic decisions. However, there is a lack of approach to streamline the abundant amount of information derived from multiple factors and to interpret the changing nature for informed policy- and decision-making in the construction industry. To address this gap, this study proposes a system-of-systems (SoS) framework to model the complex construction industry as a hierarchical system and to analyze the evolutionary and emergent phenomena, which significantly contribute to the changing and uncertain nature of the industry. The SoS framework employs a composite index as the means to broadly utilize the information derived from multiple factors and communicate the observed changes to decision-makers. To maximize the benefit of the proposed framework, this study also creates a mock dashboard to guide the use of the index for companies' strategic decision-making. © 2022 ASCE.",10.1061/9780784483961.044,,scopus; webofscience
2022,General Process Mechanism Model of Multi-domain and Multi-scale Command and Control Activities,"This paper analyzes and compares the basic attributes of command and control (C2) activities on micro-scale and macro-scale from the physical, information, cognitive and social domains, and claims that the classic theory of C2 process—OODA loop only applies to tactical C2 activities, while for strategy C2, the Planning-Readiness-Execution-Assessment (PREA) loop is more appropriate. Based on PREA loop, a new C2 process Mechanism of macro-combat system of systems to multi-domain and multi-scale C2 activities is proposed. And also the cross-domain coordination and cross-level interaction of macro-combat system of systems as well as its dynamic evolution process are advanced. The operational mechanism of C2 process of macro-combat system of systems is characterized by multiple PREA loops in multiple domains, which are hierarchically nested, concurrent and asynchronous. Also, this paper points out that the key to win for a combat system of systems is to focus more on stability over speed, maintain continuity rather than interruption, and emphasize cumulative combat effects. © 2022, Chinese Institute of Command and Control.",10.1007/978-981-19-6052-9_17,,scopus; springerlink
2022,Preliminary Evolutionary Network Model for Efficient Collaboration in Systems-of-Systems,"Collaborative systems-of-systems (CSoSs) are defined by the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge as groups of constituent systems that voluntarily work with each other toward a common goal. As the complexity, sociotechnical interactions, and cooperation of real systems increases, so too does our need to understand how to design and manage collaboration across disciplines. An agent-based model is developed that combines network evolution mechanisms with evolutionary game theory to simulate CSoSs. Collaboration efficiency (CE) is introduced as a metric by which collaboration may be measured and performance compared. Cost and strategy parameters of constituent systems are tested via CSoS model simulation to develop insights into best collaboration practices for CSoSs. Results suggest a reactive collaboration strategy or a reinforcement algorithm-based strategy produce the highest CE under certain conditions.

2022,Towards a Software Development Framework for Interconnected Science Ecosystems,"The innovative science of the future must be multi-domain and interconnected to usher in the next generation of “self-driving” laboratories enabling consequential discoveries and transformative inventions. Such a disparate and interconnected ecosystem of scientific instruments will need to evolve using a system-of-systems (SoS) approach. The key to enabling application integration with such an SoS will be the use of Software Development Kits (SDKs). Currently, SDKs facilitate scientific research breakthroughs via algorithmic automation, databases and storage, optimization and structure, pervasive environmental monitoring, among others. However, existing SDKs lack instrument-interoperability and reusability capabilities, do not effectively work in an open federated architectural environment, and are largely isolated within silos of the respective scientific disciplines. Inspired by the scalable SoS framework, this work proposes the development of INTERSECT-SDK to provide a coherent environment for multi-domain scientific applications to benefit from the open federated architecture in an interconnected ecosystem of instruments. This approach will decompose functionality into loosely coupled software services for interoperability among several solutions that do not scale beyond a single domain and/or application. Furthermore, the proposed environment will allow operational and managerial inter-dependence while providing opportunities for the researchers to reuse software components from other domains and build universal solution libraries. We demonstrate this research for microscopy use-case, where we show how INTERSECT-SDK is developing the tools necessary to enable advanced scanning methods and accelerate scientific discovery. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-031-23606-8_13,,scopus; springerlink
2023,Using modeling and simulation and artificial intelligence to improve complex adaptive systems engineering,"Designing components that provide required functionality and recommending architectures allowing for their composition are recognized objectives of systems engineering. Design ensures that constituent components work together and provide their requisite functionality. Architectures, as frameworks, encapsulate these components into a system, or systems of systems, to reach a common goal. Traditionally, design and architecture were mostly static as systems were architected and designed early in the systems engineering lifecycle and held constant through development and operation. Over the recent decades, the concept of complex adaptive systems has become common place in several domains, such as the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, or Cyber Physical Systems. These complex adaptive systems, unlike their predecessors, are no longer static but can evolve throughout development and adapt during the operations phase. Further, each component can be adaptive, quickly changing, updated, and reconfigured throughout the systems engineering lifecycle. As such, design is no longer a phase, but a continuum across the lifecycle, e.g., a continuous process. The dynamics are true for architecture, as it has evolved into a flexible framework that is not only used to bring components together, but to ensure that data are aligned, and processes are harmonized when components are selected and arranged to fulfil new tasks throughout the systems operation. This positions operating as the third leg of systems engineering, leading to the three categories of: (1) Designing (pivoting to digital engineering and digital twins to ensure functional performance); (2) Architecting (including executable architectures that evolve to ensure operational effectiveness); and (3) Operating (allowing composition, reconfiguration, adaptation to ensure operational agility). Such an enhanced view on systems engineering can only be reached by extending systems engineering to include tools developed in collaboration with complexity science, artificial intelligence, and modeling and simulation. Complexity science will allow us to understand the system as a whole, including functionality emerging from relations between components when they are composed into accidental collectives or purposeful ensembles. Artificial intelligence will provide the means needed to identify endogenous or exogenous requirements for self-modification and self-organization of components, the computational creativity needed to compose such self-modified components into new systems, and the reasoning capability to select the most feasible composition. Finally, modeling and simulation will provide the foundation for conceptualization, exploration of the possibility space, and execution, from digital twins within executable architectures to trade-off support even under deep uncertainty. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",10.1142/9789811260186_0002,,scopus
2023,Smart terminal system of systems cyber threat impact evaluation,"Systems of system-level thinking is required when the purpose is to develop a coherent understanding of the ecosystem where every user and system requirements are divided into specific parts. The smarter project, as a part of the Sea4value program of DIMECC, aims to develop harbor operations, including passenger and cargo transportation, in a way that port processes will improve, emissions will decrease, and overall security will enhance in smart ports. This paper describes cyber-Attack impacts against the Smart terminal system of systems in the cyber realm by utilizing the MITRE ATTACK® framework to map the objectives of threat actors. The Smart Terminal system environment includes ICT, ICS networks and components, communication systems, and port service systems. Internal and external threat sources or actors are hard to divide exactly because of the diversity of the threats. Hybrid threats challenge maritime domain awareness globally. The cyber threat impacts on IT and OT environments are connected to each other because of the use of internal and external networks that impact each other by combining vulnerabilities and threats. Well-working port and terminal operations require not only protected operational systems or sensor systems, but human errors must also be minimized. Objectives of threat actors are presented, categorized, and listed. Threat scenarios illustrate that cyber threats and risks are mainly similar in the maritime global-linked port community and basic hinterland trade. The networked supply chain of the business causes evolving and combined threat scenarios. European and international standards, regulations, policies, recommendations, and, e.g., guidelines by the IMO, set new cyber-Threat requirements for port and terminal services and facilities. Therefore, overall security must be considered when cyber-security is the development area. Information exchange in an understandable form is essential for maintaining business continuity. Threat information has to be transferred among stakeholders as well as cyber security codes have to be followed in the port operations of partners that are involved, for example, in operational and system-level actions. Digitalization in smart ports and terminals enhances the capacity to handle cargo and passengers more efficiently, but cyber threats evolve. © 2023 Curran Associates Inc..

The resulting societal challenges of the Anthropocene (e.g., climate change and impacts, renewable energy, adaptive infrastructure, disasters, pandemics, food insecurity, and biodiversity loss) are complex and systemic, with causes, interactions, and consequences that cascade across a globally connected system of systems. In this Critical Review, we turn to our “origin story” for insight, briefly tracing the formation of the Universe and the Earth, the emergence of life, the evolution of multicellular organisms, mammals, primates, and humans, as well as the more recent societal transitions involving agriculture, urbanization, industrialization, and computerization.

Describing how the Anthropocene systems coevolved, and briefly illustrating how the ensuing societal challenges became tightly integrated across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational scales, we conclude by proposing an evolutionary, system-of-systems, convergence paradigm for the entire family of interdependent societal challenges of the Anthropocene. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.est.2c06203,,scopus; webofscience; webofscience
2023,Supply/demand interface for disaster resilience assessment of interdependent infrastructure systems considering privacy and security concerns,"The ability to swiftly restore functionality following an extreme event is an essential characteristic of a disaster resilient infrastructure system. However, the restoration of functionality of a single infrastructure system often depends on the functionality of other systems that provide resources the considered system needs to operate and recover. Furthermore, infrastructure systems are crucial for the post-disaster functional recovery of the building stock of a community. Thus, community resilience assessment and improvement require a system-of-systems perspective, considering the post-disaster performance of several interdependent infrastructure systems and the building stock at the same time. One of the principal issues in resilience assessment and improvement is that such system-of-systems consideration may require detailed information on the vulnerability and recoverability of numerous components. While such information might be available for certain systems (e.g., housing), for others, the information might be unavailable due to privacy and security concerns (e.g., electric power supply systems or buildings housing important functions). In this paper, we propose a supply/demand interface between the system-of-systems simulator, defined within the interdependent Resilience - Compositional Demand/Supply (iRe-CoDeS) framework, and the individual infrastructure system simulators. Such an interface can be used for regional recovery simulation and resilience assessment of interdependent infrastructure systems, while allowing infrastructure system operators to maintain system’s privacy and/or security. We define a tiered supply/demand interface, where the amount of information provided by individual systems can range from system-level to component-level post-disaster evolution of resource supply and demand, assessed using expert opinion or confidential in-house models. The proposed supply/demand interfaces are illustrated in a semi-virtual case study, assessing the seismic resilience of North-East San Francisco, focusing on the effect of interdependent infrastructure on the functional recovery of residential buildings. © 2023, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10669-023-09931-0,,scopus; springerlink
2022,Transdisciplinary system of systems development in the trend to X4.0 for intelligent manufacturing,"Since the announcement of Industry 4.0 in 2012, multiple variants of this industry paradigm have emerged and built on the common platform of Internet of Things. Engineering-driven industries such as aerospace and automotive and process-driven industries such as water treatment and food processing are influenced similarly trying to adapt to the so-called fourth generation (4.0) paradigm. In essence, the main outcomes of these X4.0 adaptations (where X can be any one of Quality, Water, Procurement, Gas or a combination of industries) are the facilitation of communications between socio-technical systems and the accumulation large amount of data. As the X4.0 paradigms are researched, defined, developed and applied, many real-world examples in a variety of industries have demonstrated a lack of system of systems design consideration. Participants are inhibited from working seamlessly and lag behind events triggered in the hostile real-world internet environment. This paper examines, from a high-level system of systems perspective, how transdisciplinary engineering can create a model of evolutionary X4.0 and how intelligent manufacturing can be developed towards X4.0 within the transdisciplinary modelling framework. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/0951192X.2021.1992663,,scopus; taylorandfrancis; webofscience
2022,ALGEBRAIC SPECIFICATION OF GRAPH COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURES; [АЛГЕБРАИЧЕСКАЯ СПЕЦИФИКАЦИЯ ГРАФОВЫХ ВЫЧИСЛИТЕЛЬНЫХ СТРУКТУР],"Problems of composing algebraic specifications for computational structures represented by data flow graphs are considered. The evolution of algebraic program specification tools is briefly outlined, from many-sorted algebra via coalgebra to a category-theoretical construction of dialgebra capable of describing interactive computing nodes. As a next step, a novel category-theoretical construction called graphalgebra is proposed which allows combining dialgebras into arbitrary directed multigraphs whose edges represent computational operations at nodes and whose vertices describe data exchanged between nodes. Examples of graphalgebraic specifications for neural networks and multiprocessor computational systems are given. The method of building categories of graphalgebras via universal constructions is described. For a computational structure of the system of systems kind consisting of graph structures, methods of hierarchical construction of an algebraic specification from the specifications of components are proposed. © 2022 Federal Research Center ""Computer Science and Control"" of Russian Academy of Sciences.

2022,Software Architecture for Distributed Edge Computing Systems,"The world is progressing towards the hyper-connected era where every object in our physical world will possess built-in computing and connectivity. As the number of these smart devices grows, these Systems of Systems will transition from integrated domain-specific solutions to horizontal platforms where all systems will be designed for knowledge-based automation, driving the decentralization of computing, communications and business processes. The recent unpredictability in various business process scenarios has high-lighted the need for collaboration and the advantages of participating. Edge computing facilitates segregation of computing responsibilities between edge devices and cloud infrastructure to process and analyze data. Researchers are working on reconfigurable edge computing systems based on varied technology solutions.

2022,Modeling Bitcoin plus Ethereum as an Open System of Systems of Public Blockchains to Improve Their Resilience against Intentional Risk,"In this article, we model the two most market-capitalised public, open and permissionless blockchain implementations, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as a System of Systems (SoS) of public blockchains. We study the concepts of blockchain, BTC, ETH, complex networks, SoS Engineering and intentional risk. We analyse BTC and ETH from an open SoS perspective through the main properties that seminal System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) references propose. This article demonstrates that these public blockchain implementations create networks that grow in complexity and connect with each other. We propose a methodology based on a complexity management lever such as SoSE to better understand public blockchains such as BTC and ETH and manage their evolution. Our ultimate objective is to improve the resilience of public blockchains against intentional risk: a key requirement for their mass adoption. We conclude with specific measures, based on this novel systems engineering approach, to effectively improve the resilience against intentional risk of the open SoS of public blockchains, composed of a non-inflationary money system, “sound money”, such as BTC, and of a world financial computer system, “a financial conduit”, such as ETH. The goal of this paper is to formulate a SoS that transfers digital value and aspires to position itself as a distributed alternative to the fiat currency-based financial system. © 2022 by the authors.

2023,On the interrelationship between IoT and SoS,"The rise and evolution of the internet on the one hand and complex systems on the other hand have led to a dense and distributed network of complex systems. Emergence of new technologies like internet of things (IoT) and system of systems (SoS) is a result of such widespread growth of internet and complex system structures. The distributed network of complex systems and their interactions are necessary to solve and tackle global problems. However, there are challenges in different aspects of complex systems like security, performance, and decision-making that need further investigation. This paper studies the relationship between IoT and SoS and discusses how IoT can be considered a subcategory of SoS. Since SoS is established to analyse and solve problems of complex and large systems and facilitates the challenges in related situations, IoT as a subcategory of SoS would benefit SoS toward systematic growth and efficient problem solving.

2022,Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Cohort Speed Control Optimization via Neuroevolution,"Predictive Energy Management (PrEM) research is at the forefront of modern transportation's energy consumption reduction efforts. The development of PrEM optimization algorithms has been tailored to selfish vehicle operation and implemented in the form of vehicle dynamics and/or adaptive powertrain control functions. With the progress in vehicle automation, this paper focuses on extending PrEM into the realm of a System of Systems (SoS). The proposed approach uses the shared information among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) and the infrastructure to synthesize a reduced energy speed trajectory at the cohort level within urban environments. Neuroevolution is employed to incorporate a generalized optimum controller, robust to the emergent behaviors typical of multi-agents SoS. The authors demonstrated the use of heuristics and systems engineering processes in abstracting and integrating the resulting neural network within the control architecture, which enables novel added-value features such as green wave pass/fail classification and e-Horizon velocity prediction. The resulting controller is faster than real-time and was validated with a multi-agent simulation environment and on a real-world closed-loop track at the American Center for Mobility (ACM). The GM Bolt and Volt CAV mixed cohort testing at ACM demonstrated energy reductions from 7% to 22% depending on scenarios.  © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206364,,scopus
2021,Collaborative Automation and IoT Technologies for Coastal Ocean Observing Systems,"Coastal observing systems are typically nationally funded and built around national priorities. As a result, there are presently significant differences between countries in terms of sustainability, observing capacity and technologies, as well as methods and research priorities. Ocean observing systems in coastal areas must now move toward an integrated, multidisciplinary and multiscale system of systems, where heterogeneity should be exploited to deliver fit-for-purpose products that answer the diversity and complexity of the requirements from stakeholders and end-users. Essential elements of such distributed observation systems are the use of machine-to-machine communication, data fusion and processing applying recent technological developments for the Internet of Things (IoT) toward a common cyberinfrastructure. This perspective paper illustrates some of the challenges for sustained coastal observations and provides details on how to address present gaps. We discuss the role of collaborative robotics between unmanned platforms in coastal areas and the methods to benefit from IoT technologies. Given present trends in cost-effective solutions in ocean sensors and electronics, and methods for marine automation and communication, we consider that a distributed observation system can effectively provide timely information in coastal regions around the world, including those areas that are today poorly observed (e.g., developing countries). Adaptation in space and time of the sensing nodes, and the flexibility in handling different sensing platforms can provide to the system the ability to quickly respond to the rapid changes in oceanic and climatic processes, as well as to promptly respond to evolving stakeholder and end-user requirements. © Copyright © 2021 Mariani, Bachmayer, Kosta, Pietrosemoli, Ardelan, Connelly, Delory, Pearlman, Petihakis, Thompson and Crise.",10.3389/fmars.2021.647368,,scopus; webofscience

The existence of an engineered system is justified by purposes. The exposed system characteristics permit stakeholders to achieve these purposes. Systems are situated in their system context and may be evolved. Due to the digital revolution, a term which refers to the changes coming along with digital computing and communication technologies, there is an increased occurrence of Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) instead of pure cyber-physical systems (CPSs) or System of Systems (SoS). SoS and CPS are often denoted as smart systems if they can monitor their environment and adapt their behavior accordingly. Along with the evolution of systems across SoS and/or CPSs toward up-to-date CPSoS, the extent and number of relations between system elements increases.

2022,Digital technologies and the balance between control and empowerment in performance management,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore how manufacturing organisations’ performance measurement and management (PMM) systems are evolving when digital technologies (DTs) are deployed. It focusses on the operational level, asking whether DTs are used to promote command-and-control or empowerment-oriented performance management. Design/methodology/approach: The findings are based on a single case study from a department of a Norwegian electrochemical plant. The department recently implemented a performance measurement system (PMS) supported by DTs to capture, analyse and visualise close-to-real-time performance data on individuals and teams. The authors analysed both the management practices associated with the new PMS and how those related to other PMM-subsystems in the organisation. Findings: When seen in isolation, the new PMS was used to promote empowerment and operators reported a significant increase in perceived psychological empowerment. However, other parts of the organisation’s PMM system remained control-oriented, so that the overall balance between control and empowerment remained stable. Practical implications: New PMSs might be added to support local needs and create arenas for empowerment without disturbing the overall balance in the PMM system. Originality/value: Building on the insights from the case study, the authors propose that DTs may be deployed to promote both command-and-control and empowerment within different PMM subsystems in the same organisation. Hence, the deployment of DTs is likely to have contradictory effects, which are best understood through a “system of systems” perspective on PMMs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/MBE-04-2021-0055,,scopus; webofscience

2023,"Model maturity towards modeling and simulation: Concepts, index system framework and evaluation method","Simulation has become an essential way and sometimes the only way to study complex systems (e.g. system of systems, SoS). Simulation is the model based activity. How to build a high-quality model is the first consideration in simulation. Fidelity and credibility are the two mostly used metrices to evaluate the quality of a model. However, the definitions and evaluation methods of fidelity and credibility vary from one research to another and it’s hard to evaluate the metrics precisely. More importantly, the evolution process of a model in use cannot be directly reflected by the two metrics. Therefore, this paper introduces the model maturity to track the status of a model during its life cycle, especially in the use and management phases, which will be an important supplement to the quality evaluation system of models. The concept of model maturity is given and a framework of index system for model maturity evaluation is established. Then, a hierarchical evaluation method based on qualitative and quantitative analysis (HEQQ) for model maturity is proposed. Finally, a case study is used to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",10.1142/9789811260186_0009,,scopus; scopus; webofscience
2023,A Holistic Review of Cyber–Physical–Social Systems: New Directions and Opportunities,"A Cyber–Physical–Social System (CPSS) is an evolving subset of Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS), which involve the interlinking of the cyber, physical, and social domains within a system-of-systems mindset. CPSS is in a growing state, which combines secure digital technologies with physical systems (e.g., sensors and actuators) and incorporates social aspects (e.g., human interactions and behaviors, and societal norms) to facilitate automated and secure services to end-users and organisations. This paper reviews the field of CPSS, especially in the scope of complexity theory and cyber security to determine its impact on CPS and social media’s influence activities. The significance of CPSS lies in its potential to provide solutions to complex societal problems that are difficult to address through traditional approaches. With the integration of physical, social, and cyber components, CPSS can realize the full potential of IoT, big data analytics, and machine learning, leading to increased efficiency, improved sustainability and better decision making. CPSS presents exciting opportunities for innovation and advancement in multiple domains, improving the quality of life for people around the world. Research challenges to CPSS include the integration of hard and soft system components within all three domains, in addition to sociological metrics, data security, processing optimization and ethical implications.

2022,Model-Based Systems Engineering Approach for Simulating Urban Air Mobility Maturity Level 5 (UML-5) Operations,"A mature state of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) will see tens of thousands of simultaneous, heterogeneous passenger-carrying and cargo-carrying operations in urban areas. To describe the evolution of UAM state of operations, NASA has outlined 6 UAM Maturity Levels (UML1-UML6). The FAA and NASA have each released Concept of Operations for UML-1 and UML-4, respectively. They outline the UAM operational framework, the role of stakeholders, infrastructures, and the level of automation. A more mature states of operations begin at UML-5, where autonomous networks are highly integrated into ground-based remote piloting operations. Safe and Secured Assured Autonomy (S2A2) is a NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI) project aimed at developing autonomy-enabled algorithms for perception, sensing, coordination, planning, navigation, detecting and responding to malicious attacks on the cyber-physical systems. Verification and validation processes are being developed to certify the algorithms. The challenge remains to architect a systems integration pipeline to fit all the different aspects above into a UAM system-of-systems context. This paper uses Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach for a UML-5 operational environment where S2A2 algorithms will cohesively work together while performing their independent functions. We use SysML to define the UAM operating context, its stakeholders, their state transitions, and functions for a nominal UAM operations scenario.

2022,"Future Cities as a system of systems: Its concept, mechanism and creation; [未来城市体系: 概念, 机理与创造]","As information technology advances rapidly, cities have become more complex and irreducible. In the Anthropocene, the process of planetary urbanization continues to affect the health of the natural and social environment, and the future of cities has a profound impact on the future of mankind. The concept of Future Cities is based on the scrutiny of the urban evolution process in human history. Future Cities are different from agricultural cities as the containers of human settlement and industrial cities as the center of production. Based on interdisciplinary and rational thinking, research on Future Cities aims to establish a way toward humanity's well-being and sustainable development. From the perspective of a system of systems, Future Cities cannot be regarded as a single system as is usual. They are a much more complex system involving many systems, and this concept needs to be understood and interpreted through systems thinking. The driving force for the change is the information revolution, which has changed the carrier of information from entity to data. Thus, information as a medium has improved its operational efficiency and strengthened the interaction and interoperation between the systems in Future Cities, which emphasizes ""systemhood"" than ""thinghood"", and triggers the formation of a system of systems. When data-based information penetrates the urban space, the ""information space"" emerges, and Future Cities become a combination of physical-information-social space. The ""information space"" also opens a new dimension for systems and people in Future Cities. As for systems, technological inventions take place in the process of digitization and informatization, including human settlement systems, energy systems, traffic systems, health systems, and environmental systems. With regard to individuals, a human being becomes ""human being + information terminals"", which in turn gives birth to new lifestyles and brings social innovation. Furthermore, because of the flow of information, the boundaries of different systems will blur and the gap between the systems and inhabitants will be bridged, and the well-being of humankind can be guaranteed through the precise matching of supply and demand. The creation of Future Cities requires not only bottom-up strength and self-organization but also top-down guidance and effective regulation. Urban problems need to be solved in stages from the aspects of technology invention and social innovation. When Future Cities revolve around the people themselves, people's creation of the city will return to normal life, enhancing the sense of happiness and belonging. How to stimulate the vitality of people's creativity, form a cooperative power distribution mechanism, and improve the city's ability to self-organize and operate will be important issues for future urban society. Future Cities research is a combination of theory and practice, which should adapt to the characteristics of a system of systems. Based on the practical experience of urban strategic planning and system engineering, the research can form an ""overall strategic group"" for the design of the system of systems, to make full use of multidisciplinary advantages and diversified perspectives. The integration of future urban research will be an iterative process of resolving conflicts; this integration requires a long-term cycle of four main steps, including reaching consensus on basic concepts, revealing the formation mechanism, refining the characteristics of different systems, and integrating the system of systems. In conclusion, the concept of Future Cities explores how the city meets people's needs for a better life. Against the backdrop of the information revolution, it is urgent to discard reductionist thinking, use systems thinking to understand the future city instead, plan and build Future Cities through continuous iterative practice, and realize the sustainable development of mankind. © 2022, Science Press.

2023,Digital Twins: Enabling Interoperability in Smart Manufacturing Networks,"As Industry 4.0 networks continue to evolve at a rapid pace, they are becoming increasingly complex and distributed. These networks incorporate a range of technologies that are integrated into smart manufacturing systems, requiring adaptability, security, and resilience. However, managing the complexity of Industry 4.0 networks presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of security and the integration of diverse technologies into a functioning and efficient infrastructure. To address these challenges, emerging digital twin standards are enabling the connection of various systems by linking individual digital twins, creating a system of systems. The objective is to develop a “universal translator” that can interpret inputs from both the real and digital worlds, merging them into a seamless cyber-physical reality. It will be demonstrated how the myriad of technologies and systems in Industry 4.0 networks can be connected through the use of digital twins to create a seamless “system of systems”. This will improve interoperability, resilience, and security in smart manufacturing systems.

2022,A Multi-supplier Collaborative Monitoring Framework for Informatics System of Systems,"Managing interdependent cooperating informatics systems from multiple suppliers is a complex and challenging endeavor. Due to the lack of complete open standards, informatics systems from different suppliers are developed using incompatible protocols and programmatic interfaces (API). Often, incompatibilities also exist for informatics systems developed by the same supplier. Nevertheless, organizations must be able to monitor the systems that compose their Information Technology (IT) landscape transparently and independently of each system’s supplier. This paper discusses a collaborative networks strategy associated with adopting the Informatics System of Systems (ISoS) framework for coordinated monitoring and support afforded by different supplying responsibilities. We argue that the adopted model simplifies the integration required by the digital, and makes efficient the collaboration among technology and service suppliers in supporting products’ life cycle maintenance and evolution.

2022,A model-driven approach to machine learning and software modeling for the IoT: Generating full source code for smart Internet of Things (IoT) services and cyber-physical systems (CPS),"Models are used in both Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). SE models may specify the architecture at different levels of abstraction and for addressing different concerns at various stages of the software development life-cycle, from early conceptualization and design, to verification, implementation, testing and evolution. However, AI models may provide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision-making support. For instance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is currently the most popular sub-discipline of AI, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the observed data and can become capable of making predictions. The goal of this work is to create synergy by bringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic approach to model-driven software development for intelligent systems that require ML. We illustrate how software models can become capable of creating and dealing with ML models in a seamless manner. The main focus is on the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where both ML and model-driven SE play a key role. In the context of the need to take a Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems perspective of the targeted architecture, an integrated design environment for both SE and ML sub-systems would best support the optimization and overall efficiency of the implementation of the resulting system. In particular, we implement the proposed approach, called ML-Quadrat, based on ThingML, and validate it using a case study from the IoT domain, as well as through an empirical user evaluation. It transpires that the proposed approach is not only feasible, but may also contribute to the performance leap of software development for smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) which are connected to the IoT, as well as an enhanced user experience of the practitioners who use the proposed modeling solution. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10270-021-00967-x,,scopus

Far too often, such information lags key decision points and/or is absent of the robust, integrated, knowledge needed, given inherent barriers associated with traditional document-centric means to data sharing, analysis, and reporting.This paper provides an overview of how NASA's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evolving its policies, standards, guidance, and training to transform to eliminate such barriers, thus realizing the benefits emerging in this new digital era. A roadmap for achieving this digital future is presented along with key building blocks involving use and implementation of concepts such as: Objectives-Hierarchies, Objective-Driven Requirements, Accepted Standards, Safety and Assurance Cases, data digitization (i.e., ontologies, structured data, and model-centric data), FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,Reusable) and/or FAIRUST (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Understandable, Secure, and Trusted) principles [1]. This paper also describes how OSMA, leveraging the Agency's overall commitment to Digital Transformation (DT), is using the power of Policy, ""Digital""Domain representation, Product Evolution, and Community Outreach and Engagement as part of a strategic vision and roadmap to evolve and transform its SMA organizations to become better able to serve its stakeholders and customers. Future publications will elaborate on these building blocks and deeper concepts. © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088205,,scopus; webofscience
2023,Fine-Grained Prediction and Control of Covid-19 Pandemic in a City: Application to Post-Initial Stages,"Predicting the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic during its early phases was relatively easy as its dynamics were governed by few influencing factors that included a single dominant virus variant and the demographic characteristics of a given area. Several models based on a wide variety of techniques were developed for this purpose. Their prediction accuracy started deteriorating as the number of influencing factors and their interrelationships grew over time. With the pandemic evolving in a highly heterogeneous way across individual countries, states, and even individual cities, there emerged a need for a contextual and fine-grained understanding of the pandemic to come up with effective means of pandemic control. This paper presents a fine-grained model for predicting and controlling Covid-19 in a large city. Our approach borrows ideas from complex adaptive system-of-systems paradigm and adopts a concept of agent as the core modeling abstraction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-031-21203-1_19,,scopus; springerlink
2023,A Proposed Metaverse Framework for Food Security Based-IoT Network and Machine Learning,"Metaverse is a digital environment that enables user interaction. It is evolving into a parallel universe in which people can work, play, and interacts. Using mixed reality (MR) technology, Metaverse integrates technologies with ambient intelligence to establish a bridge between the digital and physical realities, allowing users to combine resources. When IoT is enabled, the Metaverse can build a fully integrated partnership with the physical world. In order to integrate digital, IoT plays a crucial role in the Metaverse by developing an interoperable, seamless system of systems. Meat is a crucial source of protein for the human body; however, it is susceptible to spoilage, which hurts human health. As a result, in this chapter, we use meta-veterinary in the realm of food security to detect spoiled meat. The proposed approach collects data from the physical environment using IoT gas sensors and then applies a machine-learning algorithm to judge meat quality. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is utilized in the classification model for meat quality, and it has three different kernels: linear, cubic, and quadratic. A linear accuracy rate of 97.4%, quadratic accuracy rate of 99.4%, and cubic accuracy rate of 99.9% were achieved by the performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-031-29132-6_8,,scopus; springerlink
2023,Cognitive Dependability Engineering: Managing Risks in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems under Deep Uncertainty,"The work is a context-oriented analysis and synthesis of complex engineered systems to ensure continuous and safe operations under conditions of uncertainty. The book is divided in four parts, the first one comprises an overview of the development of systems engineering: starting with basics of Systems Science and Single Systems Engineering, through System of Systems Engineering to Cognitive Systems Engineering. The Cognitive Systems Engineering model was based on the concept of imperfect knowledge acquisition and management. The second part shows the evolutionary character of the dependability concept over the last fifty years. Beginning from simple models based on the classical probability theory, through the concepts of tolerating faults, as well as resilience engineering, we come to the assumptions of Cognitive Dependability Engineering (CDE), based on the concept of continuous smart operation, both under normal and abnormal conditions. The subject of the next part is analysis and synthesis of Cyber-Physical-Social (CPS) Systems. The methodology consists of the following steps: modeling CPS systems' structure, simulating their behavior in changing conditions and in situations of disruptions, and finally assessing the dependability of the entire system based on CDE. The last part of the work answers the question of how to deal with risks in CPS systems in situations of high level of uncertainty. The concept of a Cognitive Digital Twin was introduced to support the process of solving complex problems by experts, and on this basis a framework for cognitive dependability based problemsolving in CPS Systems operating under deep uncertainty was developed. The possibilities and purposefulness of using this framework have been demonstrated with three practical examples of disasters that have happened in the past and have been thoroughly analyzed. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1201/9781003020752,,scopus
2021,Sensor selection framework for designing fault diagnostics system,"In a world of rapidly changing technologies, reliance on complex engineered systems has become substantial. Interactions associated with such systems as well as associated manufacturing processes also continue to evolve and grow in complexity. Consider how the complexity of manufacturing processes makes engineered systems vulnerable to cascading and escalating failures; truly a highly complex and evolving system of systems. Maintaining quality and reliability requires considerations during product development, manufacturing processes, and more. Monitoring the health of the complex system while in operation/use is imperative. These considerations have compelled designers to explore fault-mechanism models and to develop corresponding countermeasures. Increasingly, there has been a reliance on embedded sensors to aid in prognosticating failures, to reduce downtime, during manufacture and system operation. However, the accuracy of estimating the remaining useful life of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the data obtained. This can be enhanced by increasing the number of sensors used, according to information theory. However, adding sensors increases total costs with the cost of the sensors and the costs associated with information-gathering procedures. Determining the optimal number of sensors, associated operating and data acquisition costs, and sensor-configuration are nontrivial. It is also imperative to avoid redundant information due to the presence of additional sensors and the efficient display of information to the decision-maker. Therefore, it is necessary to select a subset of sensors that not only reduce the cost but are also informative. While progress has been made in the sensor selection process, it is limited to either the type of the sensor, number of sensors or both. Such approaches do not address specifications of the required sensors which are integral to the sensor selection process. This paper addresses these shortcomings through a new method, OFCCaTS, to avoid the increased cost associated with health monitoring and to improve its accuracy. The proposed method utilizes a scalable multi-objective framework for sensor selection to maximize fault detection rate while minimizing the total cost of sensors. A wind turbine gearbox is considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.196470.",10.3390/s21196470,,scopus; webofscience
2022,From Smart Connected Products to Systems of Systems: Case Study and Archetypes,"As the digital transformation proceeds in great strides, industrial companies move forward on their evolutionary process from smart connected products to systems of systems. Empirically grounded in an 18-month innovation project at SustainabilityCompany – a globally leading supplier of piping systems – this manuscript strives to share in-depth insights on this journey deriving archetypes of such progressions: (1) Physical Takeover, (2) Physical Partnering, (3) Digital Intruding and (4) Digital Expansion. Considering restrictions by the single-case method, we can conclude that beside operational considerations increasingly strategic deliberations need to be taken into account.

2022,Strategic robustness in bi-level system-of-systems design,"Robust designs protect system utility in the presence of uncertainty in technical and operational outcomes. Systems-of-systems, which lack centralized managerial control, are vulnerable to strategic uncertainty from coordination failures between partially or completely independent system actors. This work assesses the suitability of a game-theoretic equilibrium selection criterion to measure system robustness to strategic uncertainty and investigates the effect of strategically robust designs on collaborative behavior. The work models interactions between agents in a thematic representation of a mobile computing technology transition using an evolutionary game theory framework. Strategic robustness and collaborative solutions are assessed over a range of conditions by varying agent payoffs. Models are constructed on small world, preferential attachment and random graph topologies and executed in batch simulations. Results demonstrate that systems designed to reduce the impacts of coordination failure stemming from strategic uncertainty also increase the stability of the collaborative strategy by increasing the probability of collaboration by partners; a form of robustness by environment shaping that has not been previously investigated in design literature. The work also demonstrates that strategy selection follows the risk dominance equilibrium selection criterion and that changes in robustness to coordination failure can be measured with this criterion.  © ",10.1017/dsj.2022.2,,scopus; webofscience

As such, a PSSoS shows PSS characteristics of heterogeneity and evolvability and SoS characteristics of emergence and diversity. Neither existing PSS nor SoS development approaches fully address these characteristics. Thus, PSSoS development raises new challenges.

For the problems of conventional effectiveness evaluation method, such as the complex process and time-consuming, the intelligent evaluation method of WSoS combat effectiveness based on machine learning regression is proposed, and the optimization process of combat effectiveness based on evolutionary strategy is introduced. Taking the full connection depth regression network as the prediction model, the guiding selection principles of network hidden layer number and sample size are given on the basis of the test results of multiple data sets. The optimal output is obtained by the genetic algorithm to adjust the network input, and the high iterative performance is got.

2020,Transdisciplinary system of systems development in the trend to X4.0,"Since the announcement of Industry 4.0 in 2012, multiple variants of this industry paradigm have emerged and built on the common platform of Internet of Things. Traditional engineering driven industries such as aerospace and automotive are able to align with Industry 4.0 and operate on requirements of the Internet of Things platform. Process driven industries such as water treatment and food processing are more influenced by societal perspectives and evolve into Water 4.0 or Dairy 4.0. In essence, the main outcomes of these X4.0 (where X can be any one of Quality, Water or a combination of) paradigms are facilitating communications between socio-technical systems and accumulating large amount of data. As the X4.0 paradigms are researched, defined, developed and applied, many real examples in industries have demonstrated the lack of system of systems design consideration, e.g. the issue of training together with the use of digital twin to simulate operation scenarios and faults in maintenance may lag behind events triggered in the hostile real world environment. This paper examines, from a high level system of systems perspective, how transdisciplinary engineering can incorporate data quality on the often neglected system elements of people and process while adapting applications to operate within the X4.0 paradigms. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",10.3233/ATDE200055,,scopus; webofscience
2021,Open and Collaborative Micro Services in Digital Transformation,"The ongoing digital transformation raises the need to address the evolution of legacy systems in response to integration requirements. One challenge is integrating sensors and actuators (and their controllers), modeled as IoT elements, and linking them to data analytics, management, and operations decision support functions or processes. Since legacy technology systems follow proprietary architectures, their integration into open service-oriented architectures (SOA) requires a strategy that maintains a high degree of reliability. This paper presents the strategy adopted to integrate legacy software in an open SOA to manage an agri-food silos infrastructure. This approach follows the Informatics System of Systems (ISoS) idea and is based on the ISoS framework. A reference implementation concept is used to validate the (re)construction of legacy systems and make them ready for collaboration with agro-industry business partners considering their Enterprise Resource Planning. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",10.1007/978-3-030-85969-5_36,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

2020,Extended Enterprise Collaboration for System-of-Systems Requirements Engineering: Challenges in the Era of COVID-19,"Given the complexity and evolutionary nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS) entailing frequently changing goals and requirements, Extended Enterprise Collaboration (EEC) is needed. The idea behind EEC consists in teaming up with other stakeholders in partnerships in order to manage the skills, risks and investments required to rush the product to market. However, collaboration is far from being trivial, as it is constrained by several challenges such as heterogeneity of stakeholders and their ways of working - let alone global crisis like COVID-19. Thus, an overview of these challenges from both academic and industrial perspectives would be beneficial. With this in mind, based on a survey, this paper provides a comprehensive overview that goes beyond the challenges, to consider the benefits of, methods for, barriers and bridges to efficient collaboration. The survey was conducted among research-active academics in the field of SoS engineering, and companies in the US and European aerospace and defense industries. On the one hand, the results show that in response to COVID-19, work agreements (clear policies, commonly used processes and procedures, tools interoperability, clarity around roles and responsibilities of each collaborating firm, and proper change communication) are required in order to reduce uncertainty. On the other hand, it was revealed that “human bridges” are the backbone of EEC. It is, indeed, human factors that either impede or promote efficient collaboration. An important finding that comes in agreement with recent calls for shifting the focus from “technology-centered” to “human-centered” SoS engineering. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",10.1007/978-3-030-63479-7_26,,scopus; springerlink
2020,Toward model-based engineering management (MBEM),"The field of engineering is quickly evolving as a result of rapid technological advancements and globalization. Traditional document-based methods in engineering are no longer effective since they lack the flexibility needed to adapt to the constantly changing environment. New innovative approaches are required to cope with this sweeping transformation, and model-based engineering is one such approach. According to Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK), “A model is a simplified representation of a system at some particular point in time or space intended to promote understanding of the real system. As an abstraction of the system, it offers insight about one or more of the system’s aspects, such as its function, structure, properties, performance, behavior, or cost. Further, modeling can occur at different levels: at the component level, subsystem, system, and system of systems level and throughout the life-cycle of the system.” One of the engineering disciplines that has already benefited from adapting model-based approach is systems engineering, and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has emerged as a promising method for engineering of complex systems. The authors propose to expand MBSE to the field of engineering management and offer a Model-Based Engineering Management (MBEM) framework as a way to help organizations to effectively adapt model-based thinking in managing engineering systems, projects, and programs. In turn, this will allow organizations a more efficient transition from document-based to model-based engineering management. A case study of the Adelaide Desalination Plant is presented to illustrate an application of the proposed method. Copyright, American Society for Engineering Management, 2020.",,,scopus

2021,Research on dynamic evolution model and method of communication network based on real war game,"Based on the data in real combat games, the combat System-of-Systems is usually composed of a large number of armed equipment platforms (or systems) and a reasonable communication network to connect mutually independent weapons and equipment platforms to achieve tasks such as information collection, sharing, and collaborative processing. However, the generation algorithm of the combat system in the existing research is too simple and not suitable for reality. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a communication network generation algorithm by adopting the joint distribution strategy of power law distribution and Poisson distribution to model the communication network. The simulation method is used to study the operation under continuous attack on communication nodes. The comprehensive experimental results of the dynamic evolution of the combat network in the battle scene verify the rationality and effectiveness of the communication network construction. © 2021 by the authors.

2020,The role of 'metasystem' in engineering a system of systems,"Fundamentally, a system of systems is characterized by operational independence, managerial independence, evolutionary development, emergent behavior, and geographical distribution. However, value-wise, a system of systems should provide greater capability beyond that which individual systems can provide. Enabling this greater capability has to be purposely designed for and managed. In this paper, we argue that this is the primary role of the metasystem structure and its execution. A metasystem is a governing structure that provides coordination and integration of multiple systems, brought together to achieve overarching missions and functions beyond those of the constituent systems. This paper articulates the differences between a system of systems and a metasystem. Then the role of the metasystem is amplified in relation to meeting overarching goals for a system of systems. Next, the paper examines a set of nine metasystem functions necessary to realize greater capabilities of a system of systems. The paper concludes with implications and challenges for practitioners (owners, operators, designers, and performers) and researchers with respect to the metasystem role in system of systems. Emphasis is placed on design, execution, and evolution of metasystems as a primary driver for integration and coordination of systems of systems. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

2020,Arrowhead technology for digitalization and automation solution: Smart cities and smart agriculture,"The Internet of Things (IoT) concept has met requirements for security and reliability in domains like automotive industry, food industry, as well as precision agriculture. Furthermore, System of Systems (SoS) expands the use of local clouds for the evolution of integration and communication technologies. SoS devices need to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities including service-oriented management and different QoS characteristics monitoring. Smart applications depend on information quality since they are driven by processes which require communication robustness and enough bandwidth. Interconnectivity and interoperability facilities among different smart devices can be achieved using Arrowhead Framework technology via its core systems and services. Arrowhead Framework is targeting smart IoT devices with wide applicability areas including smart building, smart energy, smart cities, smart agriculture, etc. The advantages of Arrowhead Framework can be underlined by parameters such as transmission speed, latency, security, etc. This paper presents a survey of Arrowhead Framework in IoT/SoS dedicated architectures for smart cities and smart agriculture developed around smart cities, aiming to outline its significant impact on the global performances. The advantages of Arrowhead Framework technology are emphasized by analysis of several smart cities use-cases and a novel architecture for a telemetry system that will enable the use of Arrowhead technology in smart agriculture area is introduced and detailed by authors. © 2020 by the authors.

2020,Aerospace human systems integration: Evolution over the last 40 years,"This chapter focuses on the evolution of human-centered design (HCD) in aerospace systems over the last forty years. Human factors and ergonomics first shifted from the study of physical and medical issues to cognitive issues circa the 1980s. The advent of computers brought with it the development of human-computer interaction (HCI), which then expanded into the field of digital interaction design and user experience (UX). We ended up with the concept of interactive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but because they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the early 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the point that complex system design and management found itself center stage, with the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups. Today, human systems integration (HSI) is no longer only a single-agent problem, but a multi-agent research field. Systems are systems of systems, considered as representations of people and machines. They are made of statically and dynamically articulated structures and functions. When they are at work, they are living organisms that generate emerging functions and structures that need to be considered in evolution (i.e. in their constant redesign). This chapter will more specifically focus on human factors such as human-centered systemic representations, life-critical systems, organizational issues, complexity management, modeling and simulation, flexibility, tangibility, and autonomy. The discussion will be based on several examples in civil aviation and air combat, as well as aerospace. © 2021 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

2021,Resilience of business strategy to emergent and future conditions,"Assuring future performance of systems-of-systems through advanced-technology investments is a perpetual challenge of industry and agencies. Among the complicating factors are technology innovation, escalating scales, and diversity of software and hardware applications, increasing availability and scrutiny of big data, and evolving business, environmental, and legal contexts. These factors are engaging system owner/operators to continually reprioritize these investments, even as transparent principles for investment are needed for appropriate oversight and auditing. In this paper, a branch of resilience analysis offers to address multiple layers of uncertainty that arise from technology plans around future disruptions to large-scale systems-of-systems. The paper presents a methodology to quantify and manage the disruptive influence of individual systems perspectives to the prioritization of technology investments across the system-of-systems. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study on an information technology investment portfolio of the US Department of Commerce, USA. The experience suggests how fiscal limitations, combining with several other factors, has the largest disruption to the prioritization of investments. The results furthermore describe how investments perform relative to one another and characterize where the system-of-systems might be resilient to the perspectives of constituent systems.

2020,System-of-systems tools and techniques for the analysis of cyber-physical systems,"Dynamic and real-time adaptive configuration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) results in increased complexity due to a variety of heterogeneous and interdependent variables and creates unique challenges. For example, (a) Emergent Behavior: How do we ensure that system constituents dynamically and adaptively collaborate to produce a consistent repeatable functionality while supporting the capability to upgrade the individual entities through technology infusion; (b) Scale: How do we ensure scalability of these systems by managing complexity; and (c) Risk Management: How do we evaluate and manage the risks associated with the connection and interdependencies of heterogenous systems. Design and development of this new generation of CPSs can be viewed through the lens of System-of-Systems (SoS) methodology which is designed to analyze and assess the evolving topologies created by interactions within a large complex system operating in dynamic and uncertain environment. In this paper, we propose the use of several SoS tools and techniques for the analysis and design of next-generation CPSs. Our SoS methodologies address features such as diversity of component systems, complex hierarchical structures, dynamic and emergent behavior, and interactions between components. Therefore, they are suitable to treat some of the challenging features of CPSs. However, it is necessary to modify these methodologies to address specific aspects of CPSs. Constraints and metrics from SoS methodology, applied to the design space, will support decision on component systems and the topology of their connections, and provide a set of “good designs,” with desired characteristics. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",10.1002/sys.21539,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2021,Feeling and thought in collective action on social issues: Toward a systems perspective,"Theories of action have tended to view it—and its basis in thought and feeling—as static, discrete, mechanistic, and decontextualized. Moreover, studies of action have tended to be fragmented in academic silos. The consequences of these problems include a lack of cumulative and contextualized theory-building, and an inability to recognize emergent, dynamic, and non-linear causality, especially across levels of analysis. We argue that such problems could be partly alleviated with increased engagement with a meta-theoretical perspective that has long been advocated for in psychology—the systems approach. In this view, thought, feeling, motivation, action, and context can be viewed as co-evolving, inextricably linked, systems of systems. We illustrate the need for and benefit of this approach in the domain of collective action on social issues. We conclude that systems perspectives allow more contextualized, generalizable, conceptually rich, and applied directions for research in this domain. © 2021 The Authors.

2020,An analytical model for system-of-systems sensor detection and defense efforts,"The evolving threat of emerging technology disruptions against fixed-site locations drives frequent updates and development for new and innovative methods of sensor detection and defense efforts. Relying on a systems-of-systems methodology, researchers have modeled the most up-to-date existing capabilities against intruders at areas of interest for detection and defense analysis. The selection of a wargame approach with blue-team and red-team perspectives led to the construction of a model workflow that generates a system-of-systems response combination to identify and interdict elements surveying or breaching the perimeter of a chosen fixed site. The resulting model identifies potential defensive gaps against various red-team intrusion profiles; it also establishes the basis of a prototype model to evaluate proposed detection and defense capabilities in future years, providing a specific means to offer insights for the development of system-of-systems solutions for effective fixed-site security consistent with a wargame approach. This paper provides an overview of the methods and approach, prototype model’s framework and workflow development, and preliminary design-of-experiments process related to fixed-site security detection and defense against disruptions generated by emerging technology. © Proceedings of the 2020 IISE Annual.

2021,A Collaborative Cyber-Physical Microservices Platform – the SITL-IoT Case,"Managing heterogeneous software and hardware artifacts from multiple suppliers is a complex and challenging process. The integration of sensors, actuators, and their controllers, modeled as IoT elements, also presents significant challenges. Typically, a vendor supplies one or more parts, each one with its proprietary interface, which may raise vendor lock-in and supplier dependencies that can compromise the replacement of some of the artifacts by equivalent ones from competing vendors. The research presented in this paper addresses such challenges in the context of the SITL-IoT project aiming at transforming an industrial agri-food environment towards an open, integrated system-of-systems. We present and discuss a reference implementation of a collaborative platform to simplify the management of different artifacts, supplied by alternative suppliers, modeled as services. More specifically, the concepts of ISystem (Informatic System), CES (Cooperation Enabled Service), and Service are used to manage the different elements that compose an agri-food environment transparently and uniformly. We argue that the adopted model simplifies the collaboration among technology suppliers along the life cycle maintenance and evolution of their enabled products. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",10.1007/978-3-030-85969-5_38,,scopus; springerlink
2021,Transdisciplinary Approach in Studying Organisational Transformations: A case study in Evolution of Military Enterprises,"Digital transformation has a notorious record of failures. Maybe the enterprise architects do not have a holistic model to study and model the organisational transformation. An enterprise consists of several structural components, which vary from culture to technology layers defined in the Enterprise Architecture. Usually, the transformation of an enterprise involves most of the interrelated layers in connection to the environment around the organisation. Seemingly, no single science provides frameworks to study the transformation of a whole system of systems (including the layers of enterprise strategy, culture, business, information, and technology). Therefore, the paper proposes a transdisciplinary approach combined with spiral research design as a framework for the business sciences and enterprise architecture. The proposed framework connects different sciences of sociology, business, strategy, history, information, and technology to understand the evolutionary particularities of each layer of enterprise in transformation. The transdisciplinary approach supports the modelling of the entire enterprise in all of its complexities and over a longer time. In contrast, the current monodisciplinary focuses only on parts of an enterprise at a particular window of time. By definition, transdisciplinary research fuses findings across the disciplines, between the disciplines and beyond the disciplines. Furthermore, the framework supports spiralling between scientific methods and non-scientific practices. The case study utilised a spiralling research process that provided a tighter feedback loop from application in practice to model development in theory. The transdisciplinary spiralling approach provided an iterative approach to verify the outcome, reduce the complexity, and address the practitioner’s reality.

2021,Task capability dependency analysis of weapon system of systems based on FDN; [基于FDN的装备体系任务能力依赖性分析],"In order to deeply analyze the influence of the performance degradation of each equipment system in system of systems on interdependency among them and accurately grasp the evolution law of the current efficiency of each equipment system under the dual influence of its own performance degradation and interdependence. The traditional functional dependency network analysis (FDNA) method is improved and the self-effectiveness degradation coefficient is introduced to give a dynamic FDNA algorithm considering time factor. And the performance degradation model of the equipment system in system of systems is constructed based on the Markov process to provide the corresponding basis for the calculation of self-effectiveness degradation coefficient. Then, a task capability dependency analysis method of weapon system of systems based on the functional dependency network is proposed, and the feasibility of the method is verified by a case. © 2021, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

2020,System of systems modelling,"The design, manufacturing and through-life support of modern engineering systems such as an aircraft or a frigate are complex, multifaceted and may change over time. These engineering systems areworking in an environment that has multiple individual users, complicated supply chain, many government and socially affected stakeholders. In essence, these systems are working as a system of interacting semiautonomous systems each of which are governed by their individual set of rules and could operate with different enterprise structures. Engineers trying to apply the theory of systems engineering to ""design"" a system of systems find the outcome often unpredictable and uncontrollable, as the linked systems operate with high degree of independence. System operations are embedded in business networks that are evolving and changing all the time. Individuals and organisations participate voluntarily in the networks. They can come and go at any time without warning. This highly uncertain relationship requires a different approach. This chapter will address the modelling requirements to design, develop, implement and operate a complex system that interacts with many socio-technical systems. The methodology is illustrated by two case studies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. All rights reserved.",10.1007/978-3-030-33312-6_4,,scopus; springerlink
2020,Characterizing Systems of Systems change and failure via network-based metrics,"A System of System (SoS) is a synthesis of independent systems functioning together towards a common goal. They are characterized by their dynamic nature and evolvability during operation: Addition, removal, and modification of component systems and functions. It is, therefore, important to characterize the tolerance of such systems to changes and failures. Most change propagation and failure analysis methods require some knowledge of failure and change probabilities, failure modes, and design parameters, which is difficult to obtain or unavailable to an SoS decision-maker, as component systems are independent in their management and operation. Consequently, this paper uses highlevel SoS functional models and network-based metrics to characterize SoSs functions and assess the functional change and failure of such systems. The proposed measures are deployed on an electric vehicle to grid-related service to show how it can aid an SoS decision-maker during the system's development and operation.

2021,Iterative and Scenario-Based Requirements Specification in a System of Systems Context,"[Context & Motivation] Due to the managerial, operational and evolutionary independence of constituent systems (CSs) in a System of Systems (SoS) context, top-down and linear requirements engineering (RE) approaches are insufficient. RE techniques for SoS must support iterating, changing, synchronizing, and communicating requirements across different abstraction and hierarchy levels as well as scopes of responsibility. [Question/Problem] We address the challenge of SoS requirements specification, where requirements can describe the SoS behavior, but also the behavior of CSs that are developed independently. [Principal Ideas] To support the requirements specification in an SoS environment, we propose a scenario-based and iterative specification technique. This allows requirements engineers to continuously model and jointly execute and test the system behavior for the SoS and the CS in order to detect contradictions in the requirement specifications at an early stage. [Contribution] In this paper, we describe an extension for the scenario-modeling language for Kotlin (SMLK) to continuously and formally model requirements on SoS and CS level. To support the iterative requirements specification and modeling we combine SMLK with agile development techniques. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with the help of an example from the field of e-mobility. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-73128-1_12,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-73128-1_12,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar
2021,Cyber risk propagation and optimal selection of cybersecurity controls for complex cyberphysical systems,"The increasingly witnessed integration of information technology with operational technology leads to the formation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that intertwine physical and cyber components and connect to each other to form systems-of-systems. This interconnection enables the offering of functionality beyond the combined offering of each individual component, but at the same time increases the cyber risk of the overall system, as such risk propagates between and aggregates at component systems. The complexity of the resulting systems-of-systems in many cases leads to difficulty in analyzing cyber risk. Additionally, the selection of cybersecurity controls that will effectively and efficiently treat the cyber risk is commonly performed manually, or at best with limited automated decision support. In this work, we propose a method for analyzing risk propagation and aggregation in complex CPSs utilizing the results of risk assessments of their individual constituents. Additionally, we propose a method employing evolutionary programming for automating the selection of an optimal set of cybersecurity controls out of a list of available controls, that will minimize the residual risk and the cost associated with the implementation of these measures. We illustrate the workings of the proposed methods by applying them to the navigational systems of two variants of the Cyber-Enabled Ship (C-ES), namely the autonomous ship and the remotely controlled ship. The results are sets of cybersecurity controls applied to those components of the overall system that have been identified in previous studies as the most vulnerable ones; such controls minimize the residual risk, while also minimizing the cost of implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

2021,A workflow language for research e-infrastructures,"Research e-infrastructures are “systems of systems,” patchworks of resources such as tools and services, which change over time to address the evolving needs of the scientific process. In such environments, researchers carry out their scientific process in terms of sequences of actions that mainly include invocation of web services, user interaction with web applications, user download and use of shared software libraries/tools. The resulting workflows are intended to generate new research products (articles, datasets, methods, etc.) out of existing ones. Sharing a digital and executable representation of such workflows with other scientists would enforce Open Science publishing principles of “reproducibility of science” and “transparent assessment of science.” This work presents HyWare, a language and execution platform capable of representing scientific processes in highly heterogeneous research e-infrastructures in terms of so-called hybrid workflows. Hybrid workflows can express sequences of “manually executable actions,” i.e., formal descriptions guiding users to repeat a reasoning, protocol or manual procedure, and “machine-executable actions,” i.e., encoding of the automated execution of one (or more) web services. An HyWare execution platform enables scientists to (i) create and share workflows out of a given action set (as defined by the users to match e-infrastructure needs) and (ii) execute hybrid workflows making sure input/output of the actions flow properly across manual and automated actions. The HyWare language and platform can be implemented as an extension of well-known workflow languages and platforms. © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1007/s41060-020-00237-x,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2021,BeSoS: A Tool for Behavior-driven and Scenario-based Requirements Modeling for Systems of Systems,"Systems of Systems (SoS), like connected vehicle systems, provide their functionality by the interaction of several constituent systems (CSs). [Problem] Due to the managerial, operational and evolutionary independence of the CSs in an SoS, requirements constantly change over time and linear, top-down requirements engineering methods cannot be applied without significant adaptations. New tools are needed that support the continuous and iterative specification and alignment of requirements across different levels of abstraction. [Principal Ideas] We propose to integrate the behavior-driven development (BDD) approach with an intuitive and executable scenario-based modeling of functional requirements. In this way, stakeholder expectations can be structured via features and documented in natural language as usage scenarios. Based on usage scenarios, the modeling of functional requirements can be driven by tests, allowing for the automated testing and analysis of requirements. This in turn supports the iterative specification of requirements and the alignment of stakeholder needs. [Contribution] In this paper we showcase the tool BeSoS that supports the iterative and behavior-driven specification of requirements in an SoS context. We propose a method and describe its tool components using an example. The tool is available here: https://vimeo.com/512739942. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.",,,scopus
2020,System of systems uncertainty quantification using machine learning techniques with smart grid application,"System-of-Systems capability is inherently tied to the participation and performance of the constituent systems and the network performance which connects the systems together. It is imperative for the SoS stakeholders to quantify the SoS capability and performance to any uncertain variations in the system participation and network outages so that the system participation is incentivized and network design optimized. However, given the independent operations, management, and objectives of constituent systems, along with an increasing number of systems that collectively become a part of SoS, it becomes difficult to obtain a closed analytical function for SoS performance characterization. In this paper, we investigate and compare two machine learning techniques, Artificial Neural Network and Parametric Bayesian Estimation, to obtain a predictive model of the SoS given the uncertainty in the constituent system participation and the network conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a smart grid SoS application example and describe how the two machine learning techniques enable SoS robustness and resilience analysis by quantifying the uncertainty in the model and SoS operations. The results of smart grid example establish the value of SoS uncertainty quantification (UQ) and show how smart grid operators can utilize UQ models to maintain the desired robustness as operating conditions evolve and how the designers can incorporate low-cost networks into the SoS while maintaining high performance and resilience. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",10.1002/sys.21561,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.21561,scopus; wiley; webofscience; googlescholar

Such systems present architectures that dynamically change in a way that is not necessarily intended at the time of design. We target a kind of SoS that is subject to evolutionary development and propose a reconfiguration design process that guides the architect in charge of SoS engineering by indicating the tasks that must be accomplished to develop a reconfiguration for evolutionary development. Finally, our process is applied to design a reconfiguration in the context of a realistic case study inspired by the French emergency services. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",10.1002/sys.21567,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2021,Design considerations introducing analytics as a 'dual use' in complex industrial embedded systems,"Embedded systems are today often self-sufficient with limited and predefined communication. However, this traditional view of embedded systems is changing through advancements in technologies such as, communication, cloud technologies, and advanced analytics including machine learning. These advancements have increased the benefits of building Systems of Systems (SoS) that can provide a functionality with unique capabilities that none of the included subsystems can accomplish separately. By this gain of functionality the embedded system is evolving towards a 'dual use' purpose11In this paper we define dual usage as a control system having two purposes. In other contexts such as politics, diplomacy and export control, the term 'dual-use' refers to technology that can be used for both peaceful and military aims, e.g., nuclear power technology., The use is dual in the sense that the system still needs to handle its original task, e.g., control and protect of an asset, and it must provide information for creating the SoS. Larger installations, e.g., industry plants, power systems and generation, have in most cases a long expected life-cycle, some up to 30-40 years without significant updates, compared to analytical functions that evolve and change much faster, i.e., requiring new types of data sets from the subsystems, not know at its first deployment. This difference in development cycles calls for new solutions supporting updates related to new requirements inherent in analytical functions. In this paper, within the context of 'dual usage' of systems and subsystems, we analyze the impact on an embedded system, new or legacy, when it is required to provide analytic data with high quality. We compare a reference system, implementing all functions in one CPU core, to three other alternative solutions: a) a multi-core system where we are using a separate core for analytics, b) using a separate analytics CPU and c) analytics functionality located in a separate subsystem. Our conclusion is that the choice of analytics information collection method should to be based on intended usage, along with resulting complexity and cost of updates compared to hardware cost. © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613273,,scopus
2021,IFIP WG5.12 Architectures for Enterprise Integration: Twenty-Five Years of the GERAM Framework,"Apart from the 25-year anniversary in 2019 of the first publication of the GERAM Enterprise Architecture Framework, the timeliness of this paper lies in the new interest in the use of systems theory in Enterprise Architecture (EA), and consequently, ‘light-weight’ architecture frameworks (AFs). Thus, this paper is about the use of systems thinking and systems theory in EA and about how it is possible to reconcile and understand, based on a single overarching framework, the interplay of two major enterprise change endeavours: enterprise engineering (i.e. deliberate change) and evolutionary, organic change. The paper also demonstrates how such change processes can be illustrated by employing systems thinking to construct dynamic business models; the evolution of these concepts is exemplified using past applications in networked enterprise building, and more recent proposals in environmental-, disaster- and healthcare management. Finally, the paper attempts to plot the way GERAM, as a framework to think about the creation and evolution of complex socio-technical systems of systems, will continue to contribute to society in the context of future challenges and emerging opportunities. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",10.1007/978-3-030-81701-5_10,,scopus; springerlink
2021,Dependable Integration Concepts for Human-Centric AI-Based Systems,"The rising demand for adaptive, cloud-based and AI-based systems is calling for an upgrade of the associated dependability concepts. That demands instantiation of dependability-orientated processes and methods to cover the whole life cycle. However, a common solution is not in sight yet That is especially evident for continuously learning AI and/or dynamic runtime-based approaches. This work focuses on engineering methods and design patterns that support the development of dependable AI-based autonomous systems. The emphasis on the human-centric aspect leverages users’ physiological, emotional, and cognitive state for the adaptation and optimisation of autonomous applications. We present the related body of knowledge of the TEACHING project and several automotive domain regulation activities and industrial working groups. We also consider the dependable architectural concepts and their applicability to different scenarios to ensure the dependability of evolving AI-based Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) in the automotive domain.

2020,Cyber range solutions and services for space assets,"Cyber security is becoming increasingly challenging in the space sector. As advanced application services seamlessly leverage connectivity provided by space-based communications systems, it is understood that space assets have gained increased attention of cyber adversaries. Seamless access to space-enabled applications services and reality of complex software results in increased cyber risks to space assets and downstream services. It is well known that several nation states have established doctrine including the identified need to interfere with, damage, and destroy reconnaissance, navigation, and communication satellites. The result of the increased and evolving cyber threat is a corresponding increased attention applied to cyber security risks in all stages of development and operation across the space industry. Among the promising approaches to improve cybersecurity preparation and risk reduction is the coordinated use of Cyber Range solutions and services. A Cyber Range provides an environment to train and equip cybersecurity professionals and system operators; perform cybersecurity related research and development of space systems and advanced prototype technologies; and perform tests and evaluations of space systems and architectures in a simulated operational environment. A full functioning cyber range supporting secure space assets development and delivery should encompass the following: 1. A scalable and flexible space assets emulation environment: In order to support independent security test and evaluation of space technologies, systems and solutions, the Cyber Range must be comprised of a system-of-systems solution involving a range of emulation technologies for mission control, ground station, and satellite systems across multiple mission types and covering both mission control and data segments. 2. An adaptable test harness with standardized interfaces: In order to conduct security testing of technologies within the emulation environment, it is essential that discrete components within the end-to-end service can be independently replaced by technologies under test. 3. A cyber simulation capability: Security test and evaluation of space assets requires a range of security testing capabilities. This will include static and dynamic application testing tools, and technical vulnerability assessment and penetration testing tools. RHEA has been actively involved in delivery of cyber range solutions since 2013. RHEA is the contracted authority delivery and operations of the ESA Cyber Range at the European Space Security and Education Centre. RHEA has since developed the CITEF, a next generation cyber range that greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of virtual cyber scenarios for any information technology or operations technology domain. © Copyright 2020 by Stefan A.

2021,Event-Driven Ontology Population - from Research to Practice in Critical Infrastructure Systems,"In an interconnected world, the Systems-of-Systems (SoS) paradigm is prevalent in various domains, particularly in large-scale environments as being found in the area of critical infrastructures. Due to the characteristics of SoS and those of critical infrastructures, the realization of high level services for Operational Technology Monitoring (OTM), such as failure cause reasoning, is challenging, whereas interoperability and evolvability are most pressing. In this realm, the contribution of this paper is twofold: Firstly, we conduct a systematic literature review focusing on semantic technologies in areas like (i) semantic annotations, (ii) event log focused work in the IoT, (iii) organizational process mining, and (iv) complex event processing. Based thereupon, we elaborate towards a hybrid (semi)-automatic ontology population approach in the context of OTM by combining inductive and deductive methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-72651-5_39,,scopus; springerlink
2020,A systems perspective of dod global health engagement,"Introduction A systems perspective was used to describe U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Global Health Engagement (GHE). This description was based on DoD instructions and higher-level documents related to DoD GHE. A complex system of systems such as health care can benefit from using modeling approaches to help understand the interactions among major components. Models (conceptual, computer-based programs, realistic simulations, or training exercises) can be used to help stakeholders prioritize options and to identify important components and gaps for making performance improvements. Based on the cited documents, we identified major DoD GHE components to create a conceptual model. Materials and methods Components were selected from DoDI 2000.30 for DoD GHE. Definitions of these interacting components are given and assigned to our network model that consists of three levels: Strategic, operational, and tactical. These levels are linked by critical nodes (decision points) that allow feedback to previous levels for modifying appropriate components. A network that is reminiscent of this structure is Boyd's observe-orient-decision-act diagram. Acceptable strategic and operational plans are linked to the tactical level. Acceptable tactical components lead to the desired outcome of accomplishing the DoD GHE goals. Complex systems also have feedback loops to allow for component evaluations and modifications. Accomplishing DoD GHE goals need to have adaptable components in dynamic permissive environments. Results The network that we considered is multicomponent and interdisciplinary. The network uses DoD GHE goals as the input (observing in the observe-orient-decide-act loop) to provide relevant information. It consists of three levels of adaptable, interacting (orienting) components that are linked by critical nodes (decision points) involving the evaluation of plans and desired outcomes. Strategic components (eg, sharing, personal interactions, agreements, planning, readiness, etc.) are required to develop strategic plans, the first critical node. If these plans are acceptable, the information is passed on (feed forward, action) to the operational components (define problems, understand strategic direction and guidance, understand the operational environment, etc.). At the second critical node, the decision is made about moving the operational plans to the tactical components (eg, evaluation, data, training, etc.). Tactical components are essential to provide further information to the third critical node, desired outcomes, in accomplishing DoD GHE goals. Feedback from all critical nodes is essential to allow modifications of various components and to attain health-related interoperability in supporting security policies and military strategies. Conclusions Examining the composition of DoD GHE and creating a defined model can help identify interacting features of this complex system. All of the identified components have been associated with gaps, such as the need for monitoring and measuring tools, and standards. The current state of this system is dynamic and is evolving when confronting gaps. DoD GHE represents an intersection of global health and security in supporting U.S. national security objectives by establishing access and influence with partner nations and among health care-related government and non-government organizations, and as a result, improves the readiness, health, and safety of our military personnel. © Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2019.",10.1093/milmed/usz461,,scopus; webofscience

2021,Security and autonomic management in system of systems,"A system of systems integrates systems that function independently but are networked together for a period of time to achieve a higher goal. These systems evolve over time and have emergent properties. Therefore, even with security controls in place, it is difficult to maintain a required level of security for the system of systems as a whole because uncertainties may arise at runtime. Uncertainties can occur from internal factors, such as malfunctions of a system, or from external factors, such as malicious attacks. Self-adaptation is an approach that allows a system to adapt in the face of such uncertainties without human intervention. This work outlines the progress made towards security mitigation in system of systems using a generic autonomic management system to assist engineers in developing self-adaptive systems.

2020,Simulating systems of systems using situation/reaction paradigm,"Modeling and simulation play a major role in complex system engineering. In Systems of Systems (SoS) engineering, a special case of complex systems engineering, they help to better understand and identify the side effects associated with the integration of autonomous constituent systems. Simulation is also a way of apprehending the emerging behaviors from this integration. The dynamic and evolving nature of the SoS environment has led us to rely on their most stable part to define them, namely their mission. In this paper, we propose a simulation framework for SoS based on a mission conceptual model. Mission is defined as a set of situations that require reactions. Situations are defined by rules on facts related to the SoS environment. Reactions are defined as orchestrations of services from constituent systems (subsystems) that must be triggered when a situation is identified.

2020,Architectural Models Enabled Dynamic Optimization for System-of-Systems Evolution,"System of Systems (SoS) is designed to deliver value to participant stakeholders in a dynamic and uncertain environment where new systems are added and current systems are removed continuously and on their own volition. This requires effective evolution management at the SoS architectural level with adequate support of process, methods, and tools. This paper follows the principle of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and develops a holistic framework integrating MBSE conceptual representations and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to support the SoS evolution. The conceptual models provide a common architectural representation to improve communication between various decision makers while the dynamic optimization method suggests evolution planning decisions from the analytical perspective. The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) models using Systems Modeling Language (SysML) are used as MBSE artifacts to connect with ADP modeling elements through DoDAF metamodels to increase information traceability and reduce unnecessary information loss. Using a surface warfare SoS as an example, this paper demonstrates and explains the procedures of developing DoDAF models, mapping DoDAF models to ADP elements, formulating ADP formulation, and generating evolutionary decisions. The effectiveness of using ADP in supporting evolution to achieve a near-optimal solution that can maximize the SoS capability over time is illustrated by comparing ADP solution to other alternative solutions. The entire framework also sheds light on bridging the DoDAF-based conceptual models and other mathematical optimization methods. © 2020 Zhemei Fang et al.",10.1155/2020/7534819,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/7534819/,scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

2020,Adding a detrital actor to increase system of system resilience: A case study test of a biologically inspired design heuristic to guide sociotechnical network evolution,"Networking complex sociotechnical systems into larger Systems of Systems (SoS) typically results in improved performance characteristics including sustainability, efficiency, and productivity. The response, or lack thereof, of many SoS to unexpected constituent system failures undermines their effectiveness in many cases. SoS performance after faults can be improved by improving the SoS’s hard (physical design) or soft (human intervention) resilience. The current approaches to increase resilience are limited due to the cost and necessary of human response increasing non-linearly with SoS scale. The limitations of current approaches require a novel design approach to improve SoS network resilience. We hypothesize that biologically inspired network design can improve SoS resilience. To illustrate this, a systems dynamics model of a Forestry Industry is presented and an optimization search over potential hard and soft resilience approaches is compared to a biologically inspired network improvement. SoS network resilience is measured through the newly developed System of System Resilience Measurement (SoSRM). Our first result provides evidence that biologically inspired network design provides an approach to increase SoS resilience beyond hard and soft resilience improvements alone. Second, this work provides evidence that having a SoS constituent fulfill the ecosystem role of detrital actor increases resilience. Third, this paper documents the first case study using the new SoSRM metric to justify a design decision. Finally, this case study provides a counter-example to the theory that increased sustainability always results in increased resilience. By comparing biologically inspired network redesign and optimized traditional resilience improvements, this paper provides evidence that biologically inspired intervention may be the needed strategy to increase sociotechnical SoS network resilience, improve SoS performance, and overcome the limitations of traditional resilience improvement approaches.

2021,Heterogeneous Cyber Physical Systems of Systems,"Cyber-physical systems are the natural extension of the so-called “Internet of Things”. They are “systems of collaborating computational elements controlling physical entities.” Cyber Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) are considered “The Next Computing Revolution” after Mainframe computing (60‘s-70‘s), Desktop computing & Internet (80‘s-90‘s) and Ubiquitous computing (00‘s); because all aspects of daily life are rapidly evolving towards humans interacting among themselves as well as their environment via computational devices (often mobile), and because in most cases systems will employ their computational capabilities to interact among themselves. CPSoS enable the physical world to merge with the cyber one. Using sensors, the embedded systems monitor and collect data from physical processes, such as the steering of a vehicle, energy consumption, or human health functions. The systems are networked making the data globally available. CPSoS make it possible for software applications to directly interact with events in the physical world, for example to measure and react to changes in blood pressure or peaks in energy consumption. Embedded hardware and software systems crucially expand the functionality and competitiveness of vehicles, aircraft, medical equipment, production plants and household appliances. Connecting these systems to a virtual environment of globally networked services and information systems opens completely new areas of innovation and novel business platforms. Future CPSoS will have many sophisticated, interconnected parts that must instantaneously exchange, parse, and act on detailed data in a highly coordinated manner. Continued advances in science and engineering will be necessary to enable advances in design and development of these complex systems. Multi-scale, multi-layer, multi-domain, and multi-system integrated infrastructures will require new foundations in system science and engineering. Scientists and engineers with an understanding of otherwise physical systems will need to work in tandem with computer and information scientists to achieve effective, workable designs. In this tutorial, basic and advanced issues on the design of the future heterogeneous CPSoS are presented including relevant Blockchain technologies, reconfigurable systems, advanced sensor interfaces and human-centered design processes. Certain advanced tools for the design and implementation of the cyber parts of the CPSoS (i.e. FPGA design tools from Xilinx) are also covered. © 2021 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers - Circuits and Systems Society (IEEE-CASS).",,,scopus
2020,Extending the scope of configuration management for the development and life cycle support of systems of systems—An ontology-driven framework applied to the Enceladus Submarine Exploration Lander,"Increasingly complex systems of systems (SoS) have to be developed in ever shorter times-to-market at reduced costs and with high reliability. In addition, as the life cycle of such SoS frequently spans across several decades, customer expectations and market conditions will evolve. Systems engineering (SE)/model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and configuration management (CM) need to be ever more closely integrated to appropriately address this situation. CM as a discipline is essential for establishing traceability and controlling baseline evolutions between all the relevant pieces of information resulting from the related system life cycle processes of all constituent systems of such SoS; but for this to work, the scope of CM must be extended both throughout the entire life cycle and across all participating monolithic systems. New frameworks are needed to effectively and efficiently apply CM across SoS arrangements. This paper proposes an ontology-based, federative approach to managing the inherent complexity of CM in the context of SoS, with particular focus on a change management framework for SoS. Examples from a conceptual system that is concerned with the submarine exploration of Enceladus as part of the “Saturn exploration system” are used to demonstrate typical SE/MBSE artifacts and how CM needs to address them across the involved operational and enabling systems. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21532,,scopus; wiley
2020,Digital transformation in context of engineering collaboration,"This paper provides a novel approach for agile Digital Transformation of Enterprise Architecture Models in engineering collaboration in the automotive industry. Emergent behavior is behavior of a system that does not depend on its individual parts, but on their relationships to one another. Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture: The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF) are declared inappropriate. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the Zachman Framework on the other hand are suitable. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Zachman framework has gained a high importance in large companies. Question arises how it can be applied to SME, in particular with the collaborative engineering. As two concurrently emerging topics, the enterprise architecture (EA) and the digital transformation (DT) affect each other. Within SME, the adoption of enterprise architecture heavily depends on the position of the business owners and business leaders respectively. In the most cases, they are satisfied with an optimized workflow management. Process definitions according to TOGAF are on a very abstract level and provide solely an informal guidance that can be used as a starting point for further refinement in organizations. As a matter of fact, a SME is acting agile and flexible, and don't accept formalism easily. OpenDESC.com is an industry-focused portal for engineering collaboration with features serving especially automotive companies throughout an extended enterprise. It is a holistic service, which includes both translation of engineering data into a custom environment and secured provision of engineering data to partners in an automotive SoS. The conception consists of a high-level architecture of the platform on the perspective of 6 selected layers of the Zachman Framework. We have investigated the emergent behavior of this architecture which is expected to be easy to adapt and transform for development of new services. The findings and results of this research have a significant relevance to implementation of Digital Transformation in the complex global operations. It is contribution to coherence of Enterprise Architecture and agile Digital Transformation in development of new solutions and services. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

2018,Systems-of-systems modeling using a comprehensive viewpoint-based SysML profile,"In recent years, more and more efforts have been devoted in supporting the design of systems-of-systems (SoS). Designing such systems is a multidisciplinary problem which involves considering emergent phenomena, assuring the achievement of dependability/security requirements, guaranteeing system responsiveness, and supporting dynamicity/evolution and multicriticality of provided services. A first step towards a viable design approach is to provide a conceptual model of SoS which captures SoS concepts, and their interrelationships aiming at enhancing the understandability of SoS to stakeholders and providing the basis for further automated analysis. In this context, the AMADEOS European project is bringing together researchers and practitioners to provide the support to design SoS starting from the definition of a domain specific ontology serving as a vocabulary for SoS. Our contribution consists in the modeling of the key SoS concepts and relationships defined in AMADEOS adopting a systems modeling language visual modeling language. We propose a systems modeling language profile for SoS, and we show its applicability in a Smart Grid scenario. We show how to use the profile in a model-driven engineering process to support different types of analyses, and we discuss how to integrate the profile in a user-friendly model-driven engineering tool for SoS rapid modeling, validation, code-generation, and simulation. © 2017 The Authors.

2019,Confederated cloud—Design consideration for distributed utility computing system of systems,"Cloud computing advances are enabling cloud tenants to host and process their IT workloads in a safe, reliable, and cost-effective manner. Federated clouds help cloud providers optimize many business parameters such as computing resource utilization. Federated clouds also introduce business risks to the cloud service providers in situations such as fewer tenants and various misconfigurations of energy, security, and load distributions arising from some possible sources. Yet, the rewards outweigh the risks when the federation implementation is successful. This work proposes a different optimization strategy that clarifies and simplifies the design trade-offs for the federated clouds. We call it the confederated cloud. The strategy for it is to recruit customer groups by providing domain-specific market services to cloud service providers that have a common market or business characteristics. The confederation will be a federation of domain groups, thus forming an interim cloud grouping that will retain domain-specific privacy and governance structure and the confederation structure provide services on a more efficient or cost-effective basis than can individual cloud service providers. This will help cloud providers to increase their datacenter resource utilization, decrease energy consumption, improve security, and increase revenue. It will also support cloud providers to set a suitable computing price for each computing resource type that matches the specific cloud group domain requirements. This solution will enable domain-specific tenant groups to maintain controls of what is competitively vital and pool resources where it is advantageous to do so. The resulting architecture will be a decentralized system of systems that offers multicloud providers deployments similar to the centralized cloud federation. The confederated cloud system of systems described introduces a new system of systems engineering paradigm that uses domain-specific governance for otherwise open communities that collaborate throughout the system life cycle. The confederated cloud system of systems has no explicit requirements for the cloud provider and cloud providers will not be aware of confederation services. Nonetheless, cloud providers might also not be aware of such system of systems. A successful confederated cloud will advantageous for many tenants. This enhanced market for cloud providers will help advance and drive the evolution of federated clouds. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21473,,scopus; wiley
2018,Adaptation to extreme weather events in complex health and social care systems: The example of older people’s services in England,"Our findings contribute to a growing international literature on how conceptual models from complexity theory may be relevant to inform planning in health and social care systems, helping to adapt and improve preparedness and resilience to extreme weather events. We focus on findings from two case studies in England and their relationship to national policy for adaptation. Complexity theory helped to frame strategies for planning for events that are emergent and unpredictable. We find from our case studies that, in spite of the uncertainty involved, some ‘principles’ derived from parts of the literature on complexity theory may provide a helpful framework for the development of more robust preparedness strategies in the health and social care sector. By viewing health and social care as a ‘system of systems’, adaptation planning recognises the interrelationships of built, institutional and social infrastructures. The idea of local systems, with variable, path-dependent attributes, which are partially closed, but permeable to other parts of the wider network, leads to an actionable model of adaptation which emphasises the potential value of local self-organisation, but also underlines the importance of co-evolution across the wider system and the vital role of national initiatives and support for adaptation strategies. The value of sharing experience from local case studies across the national system, as well as among local partners, is very apparent in the experience reported here. © 2017, © European Stroke Organisation 2017.",10.1177/2399654417695101,,scopus

2019,A Study on Development and Evolution of the Intelligent Power Grid Information Communication Architecture,"According to the development plan of smart grid and the future demand of smart grid, the construction principles and development objectives of smart grid are discussed and analyzed. Based on the existing grid resources, and on the basis of ensuring full utilization of resources, a smart grid management system with significant advantages is realized, which fully guarantees the management convenience, reusability and portability of the system. On the basis of researching and analyzing the rules of the smart grid system architecture, an intelligent grid management system named ""System of Systems"" (SOS) is designed and developed, which is based on the open standard hierarchical service and replaces the old business silos with an integrated system. The smart grid system combines the scientific evolution route with service-oriented as the core feature to achieve a highly integrated management system to ensure the standardization of system data interaction protocols and the adequacy of data interfaces. In order to achieve good adaptability and compatibility of the smart grid system, the system can be optimized and adjusted flexibly and conveniently according to future changes in demand to ensure the reliability and stability of the system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1742-6596/1345/5/052047,,scopus
2019,Estimation of the Belonging Metric in a Hypothetical System-of-Systems,"This paper presents application of an analytical technique that permits assessment of the strength and character of the belonging attribute in systems-of-systems (SoS). We further explore the quantification of this metric using a target system consisting of a migrating waterfowl flock. We used an agent-based model to simulate the formation and evolution of the SoS over time, and we assessed the aerodynamic benefit transferred among flock members in order to compute the belonging value. Results from model runs show that an evaluation of the overall SoS goal emerges organically from the transfer of drag reduction benefits among flock members; that benefits accrue to each individual member system as well as to the collective; and that the degree to which belonging benefits the whole varies depending on initial choices made regarding the architecture of the SoS. As an exploration of the underlying system characteristics, we propose that these results can inform the design of engineered systems. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/JSYST.2019.2904933,,scopus; webofscience
2019,"Modelling the efficacy of assurance strategies for better integration, interoperability and information assurance in family-of-system-of-systems portfolios","Military systems, and more broadly society’s, are increasingly complex and interconnected enabling hitherto only dreamed of capabilities and yet also humanity’s forays into wholesale malicious cyber-warfare. Loosely coupled families-of-systems of systems cooperate and evolve sporadically when using linear lifecycles and project-by-project development, defying capability control and assurance at that mesa-level. The U.S. Defense has evolved systematic ways for their families-of-systems to be progressively more integrated, interoperable and information assured and this is dramatically differentiating its capability assurance from its allies. This paper reports new Markovian testability modelling comparing the abstract efficacy of assurance experimentation and testing strategies employed by Australia Defence against the new U.S. strategies that are now able to quantitatively illustrate the widening gap between these allies. The modelling technique has potential to tailor Australian plans to keep pace with its ally and in modelling civilian families-of-system-of-systems in transportation, energy healthcare and the like. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",10.1007/978-3-030-02886-2_3,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2019,Major Challenges of Systems-of-Systems with Cloud and DevOps - A Financial Experience Report,"The term Systems-of-Systems (SoS) refers to a complex system that comprises other systems (the constituent systems), which have operational and managerial independence, geographical distribution, emergent behavior, and evolutionary development processes. DevSecOps (or SecDevOps) offers an approach to guide the implementation of IT Processes, which in turn may support the integration of a cloud environment to a systems-of-systems environment, incorporating information security practices, as well as fostering collaboration between both development and operation teams. It also aims to promote automation of IT processes so that the development of applications and / or services is fast and secure. However, there is a lack of detail in the process definitions to guide the implementation and use of DevSecOps in a Systems-of-Systems environment, especially when it is intended to merge cloud computing into pre-existing conventional infrastructures. In this context, this paper aims at describe the main actions, concerns and lessons learned, during planning and implementation phases, about IT Processes and IT Governance Model to transform an IT traditional environment into Systems-of-Systems environment, considering DevSecOps standards in a large Brazilian financial institution. It will show how IT Processes and IT Governance Model should be changed for incorporating a Cloud environment to a SoS. For doing so, we proposed the use of DevOps techniques as a means to reduce development time without to affect the quality and information security. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/SESoS/WDES.2019.00010,,scopus; webofscience
2019,Architecting federations of systems: A framework for capturing synergy,"This paper defines Federations of Systems, introduces a tailored architecting framework, and demonstrates it in a satellite design case study. While certainly not being new concepts in the literature, federations are a class of Systems of Systems (SoS) that have not been extensively explored due to the scarcity of applied examples and still few practitioners facing their specific design challenges. This is expected to change with the advent of the Internet of Things, Machine to Machine applications, collaborative consumption, and Federated Satellite Systems. It has become henceforth necessary to develop approaches in design and architecting capable of addressing such interconnected sets of systems. Federations are SoS characterized by the absence of global goals and stakeholders, and cooperation enabled only on an opportunistic basis. Systems engage in federations when the perceived benefit exceeds the costs of the necessary interfaces. The proposed framework quantifies the upper limits to the net benefits of cooperation between systems through the concept of synergy. Using synergy as a heuristic to navigate federated design spaces, the framework predicts the appearance and evolution of federations. The demonstration of the framework in a six-satellite federation shows that advantages of federating emerge with the collaboration between just two systems. Interface costs, architectural cost preferences, and network topology drive the achievable benefits. Specifically, when considering communication architectures under 80 MUSD for satellite systems, federating is advantageous when the interface lifecycle costs are below 15 MUSD. This demonstration case exemplifies how federating can assist systems in achieving design points that dominate the solutions of their local tradespace. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21482,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2019,Systems of systems: From mission definition to architecture description,"Systems of Systems (SoS) encompass a group of distributed and independent systems. This class of systems requires recurrent adaptation at runtime owing to the uncertainty and variability of the runtime environment. Thus, during their execution, SoS can deviate from the initial specification, which is often a consequence of successive evolutions. This problem occurs mainly due to (a) weak communication between the SoS analysis stage and architecture stage and (b) the lack of links between the operational planning in the SoS analysis stage and systems that must be involved in the SoS architecture stage. This paper proposes a model-based process that strengthens the links between the SoS analysis stage and the architecture stage in the wave life cycle. We ensure that the mission and role concepts for the SoS definition are sufficiently abstract to allow adaptation to the variability of the environment. This definition is translated into an abstract architecture that guides the choices of the system architect during the design and evolution stages. The proposed language is an adaptation of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). Furthermore, we define a crowd management SoS to illustrate the process. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21523,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.21523,scopus; wiley; webofscience; googlescholar
2019,Evolution Model of Equipment Support Network Considering Interdependent Relationship; [考虑节点相依关系的装备保障网络演化模型],"With the continuous evolution of equipment support system of systems from traditional hierarchical tree structure to complex network structure, the original research methods and evolution laws can not solve the multi-network evolution problems encountered well. Based on the interdependence among different sub-network nodes, the theory of interdependent network is applied to the evolutionary analysis of equipment support network. The network characteristics of equipment support system of systems are analyzed, and the measures of network robustness are defined based on the maximal connected subgraph and network support efficiency. In the network evolution model, the evolution rules and steps of the model are determined according to the equipment support mechanism, the network interdependency proportional parameter F, which represents the proportion of maintenance, storage and supply nodes with interaction, and the interdependence redundancy parameter K, which represents the average number between some maintenance node and its neighbors in storage and supply network, are defined, and their effects on network robustness are analyzed through simulation. The simulated results of evolution model show that the robustness and overall support efficiency of interdependent network can be improved by controlling the parameters K and F. © 2019, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii.

2018,Developing and evolving a DSL-based approach for runtime monitoring of systems of systems,"Complex software-intensive systems are often described as systems of systems (SoS) due to their heterogeneous architectural elements. As SoS behavior is often only understandable during operation, runtime monitoring is needed to detect deviations from requirements. Today, while diverse monitoring approaches exist, most do not provide what is needed to monitor SoS, e.g., support for dynamically defining and deploying diverse checks across multiple systems. In this paper we report on our experiences of developing, applying, and evolving an approach for monitoring an SoS in the domain of industrial automation software, that is based on a domain-specific language (DSL). We first describe our initial approach to dynamically define and check constraints in SoS at runtime and then motivate and describe its evolution based on requirements elicited in an industry collaboration project. We furthermore describe solutions we have developed to support the evolution of our approach, i.e., a code generation approach and a framework to automate testing the DSL after changes. We evaluate the expressiveness and scalability of our new DSL-based approach using an industrial SoS. We also discuss lessons we learned. Our results show that while developing a DSL-based approach is a good solution to support industrial users, one must prepare the approach for evolution, by making it extensible and adaptable to future scenarios. Particularly, support for automated (re-)generation of tools and code after changes and automated testing are essential. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10515-018-0241-x,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10515-018-0241-x,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar; scopus
2019,Model and data-driven system portfolio selection based on value and risk,"System portfolio selection is a kind of tradeoff analysis and decision-making on multiple systems as a whole to fulfill the overall performance on the perspective of System of Systems (SoS). To avoid the subjectivity of traditional expert experience-dependent models, a model and data-driven approach is proposed to make an advance on the system portfolio selection. Two criteria of value and risk are used to indicate the quality of system portfolios. A capability gap model is employed to determine the value of system portfolios, with the weight information determined by correlation analysis. Then, the risk is represented by the remaining useful life (RUL), which is predicted by analyzing time series of system operational data. Next, based on the value and risk, an optimization model is proposed. Finally, a case with 100 candidate systems is studied under the scenario of anti-missile. By utilizing the Non-dominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) algorithm, a Pareto set with 200 individuals is obtained. Some characters of the Pareto set are analyzed by discussing the frequency of being selected and the association rules. Through the conclusion of the whole procedures, it can be proved that the proposed model and data-driven approach is feasible and effective for system portfolio selection. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/app9081657,,scopus; webofscience
2018,How to support creativity in the complex IoT with ethics and trust for users,"The World Wide Web and Internet of Things are revolutionizing how individuals interact with each other and the environment around them. Using natural language, users can interface with other people and devices which will learn and ""understand"" the user traits. Although this may simplify how an individual or group uses the digital IoT ecosystem, the actual complexity of the underlying system-of-systems digital IoT ecosystem is still exponentially increasing. This complexity requires us to contemplate how we organize, learn, and develop the wisdom and tools to architect the future in a dependable and trusted environment to protect and benefit individuals and society. This is particularly important when inventions lead to new applications not complemented during the initial development: example ARPA Net (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) to wireless fifth-generation (5G) RF and optical networks and IoT ""devices"" for Smart - individuals, homes, buildings, infrastructures, and cities.

2019,Porous system boundaries,"Boundary conditions are an ongoing problem to accurately model any system. A typical complaint, especially with complex and complex adaptive systems, is that system boundaries have been drawn poorly. In reality, the boundaries are constantly evolving over time, are at multiple levels of aggregation, have interdependent interfaces, and can be different depending on the perspective of the stakeholder. The interfaces between each level can have a positive or negative impact, depending on the macro-view of each level. If a level of a system desires to have organized subsystem boundaries, this dictates not only how the interfaces from its parent level need to be organized, but also what kind of interfaces are forced onto its child. This paper will describe the elements found in a system consisting of porous system boundaries. Porous system boundaries incorporate the use of system and System of Systems techniques to show adaptation of external influences at lower levels. Used throughout this paper is an example of a new organizational architecture at a generalized company to illustrate adaptation due to external influences. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

2018,How to deal with the complexity of future cyber-physical systems?,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computation, networking and physical processes to produce products that are autonomous, intelligent, connected and collaborative. Resulting Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) have unprecedented capabilities but also unprecedented corresponding technological complexity. This paper aims to improve understanding, awareness and methods to deal with the increasing complexity by calling for the establishment of new foundations, knowledge and methodologies. We describe causes and effects of complexity, both in general and specific to CPS, consider the evolution of complexity, and identify limitations of current methodologies and organizations for dealing with future CPS. The lack of a systematic treatment of uncertain complex environments and “composability”, i.e., to integrate components of a CPS without negative side effects, represent overarching limitations of existing methodologies. Dealing with future CPSoS requires: (i) increased awareness of complexity, its impact and best practices for how to deal with it, (ii) research to establish new knowledge, methods and tools for CPS engineering, and (iii) research into organizational approaches and processes to adopt new methodologies and permit efficient collaboration within and across large teams of humans supported by increasingly automated computer aided engineering systems. © 2018 by the authors.

2019,A systemic approach for disruption risk assessment in oil and gas supply chains,"Twenty-first century systems are characterised by rapid changes and constantly evolving dynamics. Therefore, supply chains have become more globalised and complex than ever before. Global supply chains are often accompanied by serious threats and significant additional risks to industries that rely heavily on them. The oil and gas industry encounter significant supply chain risks throughout all stages. The objective of this paper is to provide a holistic complex system governance (CSG) perspective to investigate disruption risks in oil and gas supply chains. As a case study, the piracy problem in Africa is used to demonstrate the efficacy and extensibility of the CSG perspective to a wider array of potential supply chain disruptions. Unlike ready-made solutions or 'off-the-shelf' strategies that may actually undermine the establishment of a resilient global oil and gas supply chain, this paper examines associated risks as a complex system, or a system of systems problem.

2019,Education for Sustainability: Lessons from Living Systems Governance,"To survive that is to eat and not to be eaten. Whatever its spatial and temporal level of or-ganisation, every living system owns 7 invariant capacities (the gauge invariance paradigm). Emerging by embedments and juxtapositions of previous systems, every living system-of-systems is both depen-dent and independent from its new global level of organisation and past and present local situations of emergence. Mass growth governs growth phase duration. Local actors, modules of past, present and new modules of modules become mutually integrated (percolation process) into a new Whole through their merging into an ARMSADA (Association for the Reciprocal and Mutual Sharing of Advantages and DisAdvantages). Reversely (systemic constructal law) the global Whole is integrating the local parceners. Whatever the organisation level, the living systems obey the same principle of evolution and emergence, the volume and time of generation of the adult system obey a correlation: The mass controlled duration of acquisition of the reproductive capacity and the volume at its acquisition are linked by a 3/2 exponent power law. This dynamic fractal law is invariant, between and within le-vels of organisation. Brownian motion is the basic phenomenon of growth control: Matter and energy are exchanged at a constant flow rate. A Pareto-like relationship governs limits and limitations: Mutual survival depends on reciprocal limitations, through interactive feedbacks, for the best and for the worst. To survive that is to transform disadvantages into advantages and to avoid advantages turn to disadvantages. © 2019, Science Press (China). All rights reserved.",10.21078/JSSI-2019-199-28,,scopus
2019,Artificial intelligence engineering for postsecondary education digital transformation,"We present conceptual foundations for artificial intelligence, expert systems, and knowledge engineering and management and discuss high quality in education. Following, we discuss the basics of our vision and prospective about higher education (HE): the battle for the future with digital transformation (DT). Next, we present our central Chapter 4 on DT: our dual model of knowledge and data, as befits a HE institution. Below, we present a succinct outline of our architectural model. The pillars of the architecture are funding, research, entrepreneurship and social projection (Chapter 8); recognizing from the start that knowledge has its ethos in the university; these pillars correspond to: • Productive ecosystem of the DT • DT that enhances knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capabilities • A new economy that requires the U transformation as social projection. • New DT human talent required by the new knowledge and intelligence industry. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills is required. Ten Views of Our DT Model, given its complex process that takes place in long ways, a process required for the successful survival of an organization into the IV Industrial Revolution, with the final purpose of being very competitive, productive and of high quality (HQ). The DT views, namely: 1- The DT Ecosystem. 2- The structural vision or the pillars of the DT mentioned. 3- The DT strategic map, showing scenarios, actors and vision-mission. 4- The architectural components for DT: 8 architectures were developed and implemented, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented in the last 10 years at FESSANJOSE (U. San José), leading DT in postsecondary education (PSEd). 5- Digital 360° architecture of DT Academy and Administration LOCUS: this architecture is the digital portfolio that implies the organization of the subsystems to obtain better and/or new functionalities based on knowledge to obtain an intelligent behavior. The DT multilayer-architecture approach is a system of systems (SoS) one, which ensures compliance with government policies, norms and standards, in a highly complex social institution with digital assets; this approach describes the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is composed, and with the protocols by which the subsystems communicate. It provides a 360° business vision map and a planning framework for commercial and technological changes. 6- The computational-mathematical perspective of DT, identifying endogenous and exogenous variables and their interrelations. 7- The synthesis, the Matrix of End-Means (EMM) that summarizes in DT: Where the HE is. In addition, where can the HE go? 8- The MIR Matrix, which describes DT Objectives, impacts-indicators and results. 9- The dynamic model of the DT system, based on computational intelligence, representing the system information control of all the components to achieve the completion of the DT. The intelligent management information system (iMIS) for PSEd, shows the dynamics of DT, integrating several multilevel system hybrid architectures, as a space to respond to the solution of the HE problems, tending to the desired competitiveness, specifically pointing out the way that these modern technologies can be included for their adaptation and evolution in PSEd in post-modernity, making governability, and teaching and student productivity compatible with educational high quality, the purpose of DT. The interface Results of the iMIS includes: high quality metrics, digitization rate progress, indicators (an special appendix on KPI were included) and values of management, desertion, answers, and plans.

2018,Modeling and Robust Optimization for System of Systems Problems under Uncertainty,"The paper proposes a novel idea for how to model and optimize uncertain problems of system of systems (SoS). Firstly, the background and necessity on researching SoS and its robust optimization under uncertainty are introduced. Secondly, preparatory models are constructed to model the aggregations and cooperation among SoS and are regarded as the main body of further studies. Subsequently, a scenario-based model to formulate uncertainties and a Markov-based model to simulate uncertainty evolutions of SoS are introduced. Then, a novel idea for how to solving robust optimization under uncertainties in single-stage and multi-stage is proposed. The methods of the researches can be applied to solve SoS problems under uncertainty in real world, such as transportation systems planning, power grid systems operation and competition considered financial cooperation etc. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/CCSSE.2018.8724800,,scopus
2020,Complex systems and control: the paradigms of structure evolving systems and system of systems,"This chapter deals with two rather new notions of complexity emerging in Engineering Systems, reviews existing approaches and results and introduces a number of open problems defining a research agenda in the field. We examine these notions based on the fundamentals of a systemic framework and from the perspective of Systems and Control Theory. The two new major paradigms expressing forms of engineering complexity which have recently emerged are the new paradigms of Structure Evolving Systems (SES) and Systems of Systems (SoS). The origin and types of complexity linked to each one of these families are considered, and an effort is made to relate these new types of complexity to engineering problems and link the emerging open issues to problems and techniques from Systems and Control Theory. The engineering areas introducing these new types of complexity are linked to the problems of Integrated System Design and Integrated System Operations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",10.1007/978-3-030-18572-5_1,,scopus; springerlink
2019,Software mediators as first-class entities of systems-of-systems software architectures,"Context: In contrast to traditional software systems that are mostly created from scratch, current software systems are engineered as a junction of systems already in operation. Examples can be found in domains, such as smart cities, crisis and emergency, IoT, big data, industry 4.0, and connected health systems. Most of them can be considered systems-of-systems (SoS), since they refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, which are sometimes distributed over different environments. Therefore, SoS software architectures must be dynamic, evolve over time, and support the execution of emergent behaviors to accomplish SoS missions. They must be also designed to enable the connection of heterogeneous systems, making possible their interoperation, communication, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration, most of the times, in a seamless way. Similar challenges have been addressed by using software mediators as architectural entities. However, the application of mediators in SoS has not been properly explored. Goal: This article introduces MediArch, a layered architecture that considers mediators as first-class software entities to be used in the construction of SoS architectures. Our objective is to present evidence about how MediArch’s can support the construction of SoS architectures. Methods: The following four steps were conducted to define MediArch: (1) identification of mediation requirements to allow SoS properties; (2) establishment and categorization of twelve types of mediators, for enabling capabilities of communication and control of constituent systems interactions and conversion of heterogeneous messages exchanged through a mediation infrastructure; (3) specification of duties, behaviors, assumptions, and guarantees of mediators; and (4) organization of MediArch in three layers, namely, the constituents & consumer systems layer; the communication, conversion, & coordination layer; and the control layer. This architecture was used as the backbone for the software architectures of two SoS in different domains, namely, flood monitoring system-of-systems (FMSoS), and health-care supportive home system-of-systems (HSH-SoS), for providing evidence on how MediArch supports the architecting process of SoS. Results: MediArch (1) supports the integration of independent constituent systems, (2) provides strategies to manage emergent behaviors, (3) defines different schemes of control authorities, (4) offers elements to support SoS evolution, and (5) promotes the resilience and adaptability of SoS architectures. Conclusions: Although MediArch contributes to the establishment of SoS architectures, some challenges related to performance, resource consumption, security, safety, and non-disruptive reconfigurations must still be overcome. © 2019, The Author(s).",10.1186/s13173-019-0089-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13173-019-0089-3,scopus; springerlink; googlescholar
2019,Toward 'Smart' system of systems engineering (SoSE) Management: An evolving toolbox approach,This paper discusses the need for an Evolving Toolbox in the field of SoSE management. A new paradigm is needed now to cope with ever-increasing levels of complexity that occur within engineered SoS. This paper proposes an Evolving Toolbox which will allow SoSE management to become 'smart.' The Evolving Toolbox will have several features necessary in successfully managing SoS. An initial range of toolsets is suggested. These toolsets interact inside the toolbox allowing emergence to occur. The toolbox is open to the external environment and so the tools can adapt. There is also the capacity for newly emerging tools to be integrated into the toolbox. This proposal will lead to more efficient and effective management and could have implications for standardization and certification in SoSE. New tools can emerge within the cloud including tools which are proprietary to SoS. © 2019 IEEE.,10.1109/SYSOSE.2019.8753851,,scopus
2018,"Evolution of systems engineering scholarship from 2000 to 2015, with particular emphasis on software","Systems engineering in 2018 has many challenges, both to build the complex systems of systems of the future, and to build the complex systems of which they are composed. Systems engineering needs to be able to design around stable requirements when there are long-lead manufactured items to be incorporated, and also needs to be able to evolve the design along with evolving requirements for larger systems. The “systems engineering of yesterday,” which, when done well, greatly enhanced the design and use of stand-alone systems, has to be extended to adequately cover evolving systems of systems, being agile and resilient and responsive. This paper compares articles in 1 year of the first 5 years and 1 year of the last 5 years out of the 20-year history of the Systems Engineering journal, and considers generality via lexicographic trend analysis. Based on the topics addressed by the articles in each year, there is more interest today in the larger system (e.g., economics, simulation of the environment, systems-of-systems), on quality attributes (more often called “ilities” or life-cycle properties in systems engineering) and on modeling, management, and technology maturity. There is less interest today in process and requirements. These can be explained by systems engineering having moved away from initially deeply-explored topics into new areas. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21441,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.21441,scopus; wiley; webofscience; googlescholar
2019,A study of an adaptive approach for systems-of-systems integration,"Systems-of-systems are a growing composition of complex, autonomous and heterogeneous systems that collaborate in order to achieve complex and evolving targets that exceed the sum of the parts. In fact, the biggest challenge in such environment lays in the preservation of the viability of the system-of-systems and its evolvement while handling component systems' dynamic integrations. This also represents a pressing issue in systems-of-systems engineering. In this paper, we present a collection of definitions dedicated to sire the system-of-systems' concept, their characteristics and typology. Next, we detail the challenges facing the integration process in systems-of-systems. Then, we present our proposition to manage this issue. It is based on an adaptive integration approach to systems-of-systems typology. Two case studies are provided in order to experiment our theory. We evaluate the performance of the approach in both cases. Results are cross-compared. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJSSE.2019.097895,,scopus
2019,A governance perspective for system-of-systems,"The operating landscape of 21st century systems is characteristically ambiguous, emergent, and uncertain. These characteristics affect the capacity and performance of engineered systems/enterprises. In response, there are increasing calls for multidisciplinary approaches capable of confronting increasingly ambiguous, emergent, and uncertain systems. System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) is an example of such an approach. A key aspect of SoSE is the coordination and the integration of systems to enable ‘system-of-systems’ capabilities greater than the sum of the capabilities of the constituent systems. However, there is a lack of qualitative studies exploring how coordination and integration are achieved. The objective of this research is to revisit SoSE utility as a potential multidisciplinary approach and to suggest ‘governance’ as the basis for enabling ‘system-of-systems’ coordination and integration. In this case, ‘governance’ is concerned with direction, oversight, and accountability of ‘system-of-systems.’ ‘Complex System Governance’ is a new and novel basis for improving ‘system-of-system’ performance through purposeful design, execution, and evolution of essential metasystem functions.’. © 2019 by the authors.

2019,Conceptual Description of Nature-Inspired Cognitive Cities: Properties and Challenges,"Smart cities result from the wide adoption of information and communication technologies aimed at addressing challenges arising from overpopulation and resources shortage. Despite their important and fundamental contributions, ICT alone can hardly cope with all the challenges posed by growing demands of overpopulated cities. Hence, novel approaches based on innovative paradigms are needed. In this article we revise the concept of Cognitive City founded on Siemens’ Connectivism and understood as the evolution of current smart cities augmented with artificial intelligence, internet of things, and ubiquitous computing. We present the concept of cognitive city as a complex system of systems resembling complex adaptive systems with natural resilient capabilities. We build and propose our model upon the principles of decentralized control, stigmergy and locality, multi-directional networking, randomness, specialization and redundancy. Also, we show a realistic application of our model. With the aim to set the ground for further research, we summarize the main challenges that remain open, both from a societal and technical perspective. Hence, the goal of this article is not to provide a solution to those challenges but, to raise awareness on the problem, and foster further research in the multiple lines that remain open. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-19651-6_21,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2019,Conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of a modern enterprises part 1. Digital platform and digital ecosystem; [Концептуальная модель цифровой платформы для кибер-физического управления современным предприятием Часть 1. Цифровая платформа и цифровая экосистема],"The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of modern enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focuses on automation of physical processes, Industry 5.0 is oriented on digitization of knowledge and automation of reasoning processes for creating artificial intelligence that is able to manage enterprises. This still emerging era will be characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and humans. The paper shows that implementation of such production and logistics management systems will require development of new models and decision-making methods based on knowledge and semantic information processing, integration of computational and communication components, accumulation of big data and its processing for predictive analytics, blockchain technologies for fixing mutual obligations of systems components in the form of smart contracts, as well as human-machine and software interfaces. Existing approaches to creation of digital platforms within the digital economy of Industry 4.0 and their limitations are analyzed. The concept of digital ecosystem is developed as an open, distributed, self-organized ""system of systems"" of smart services capable of coming up with solutions and automatically resolving conflicts through negotiations and concessions. The concept of the digital platform within Industry 5.0 is described, which will be able to support functioning of the digital ecosystem of ""smart services"" of cyber-physical management of both individual objects and enterprises of humans and robots, and in the future, industries of such enterprises - implemented using self-organizing autonomous agents at all levels. © 2019 Mekhatronika, Avtomatizatsiya, Upravlenie.

2018,A review and future directions of SOA-based software architecture modeling approaches for System of Systems,"Software architecture is a software system’s earliest set of design decisions that are critical for the quality of the system desired by the stakeholders. The architecture makes it easier to reason about and manage change during different phases of complex software life cycle. The modeling of software architecture for System of Systems (SoS) is a challenging task because of a system’s complexity arising from an integration of heterogeneous, distributed, managerially and operationally independent systems collaborating to achieve global missions. SoS is essentially dynamic and evolutionary by design requiring suitable architectural patterns to deal with runtime volatility. Service-oriented architecture offers several architectural features to these complex systems; these include, interoperability, loose coupling, abstraction and the provision of dynamic services based on standard interfaces and protocols. There is some research work available that provides critical analysis of current software architecture modeling approaches for SoS. However, none of them outlines the important characteristics of SoS or provides detailed analysis of current service-oriented architecture modeling approaches to model those characteristics. This article addresses this research gap and provides a taxonomy of software architecture modeling approaches, comparing and contrasting them using criteria critical for realization of SoS. Additionally, research gaps are identified, and future directions are outlined for building software architecture for SoS to model and reason about architecture quality in a more efficient way in service-oriented paradigm. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11761-018-0245-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11761-018-0245-1,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar
2019,A perceptive interface for intelligent cyber enterprises,"Large scale, complex, networked enterprises, as may be considered (trans)national energy systems, multi-national manufacturing enterprises, smart cities a.s.o. are structures that can be characterized as systems of systems (SoS) and, as such, require specific modelling paradigms and control architectures to ensure their successful running. Their main characteristic is the necessity of solving practically one-of-a-kind problems with respect to the external context and internal configuration, thus dealing with dynamically evolving flows of data and information. The paper introduces the concept of intelligent cyber-enterprise, as an integrating paradigm that uses information and knowledge dynamics, in order to model and control SoS, especially focusing on the importance of appropriately adapt external and internal perception of an enterprise through a new generation of sensorial systems—the perceptive interfaces. The authors analyze sensing and perception in relation to intelligent cyber enterprise model and propose an implementation for a perceptive system interface. © 2019 by the authors.

2017,Emergence as innovation in systems of systems-A three systems model,"While emergence tends to be discussed as an outcome of a system of systems (SoS), it should be viewed as a process. Emergence is often the result of innovation within an SoS. We contend that, because of the complex adaptive nature of SoS, the assessment of the potential for innovation to create positive change is necessary for effective evolutionary planning. Innovation potential represents the convergence of three systems: The system of interest, the innovation system, and the context where these interact and come together. The three-system model is a useful perspective to assess the potential impact of innovation on the evolution of an SoS, and to describe the context of SoS emergence as enabled or constrained by its innovation system. We describe a set of methods and tools adapted from both SoS engineering and human-centered design which can be used for strategic design and planning of SoS evolution. The methods and tools are discussed with respect to the potential emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into the context of urban transportation systems, a complex adaptive SoS. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2017.7994975,,scopus
2017,Cyber-physical product-service systems – challenges for requirements engineering,"These days, manufacturers need to improve both their products and services, as well as their technological base to achieve a more sustainable value proposition, to become more efficient and effective in the market, and to satisfy user needs. Significant emerging technologies being discussed in various research studies include networked and smart-environments connected by Internet of Things (IoT), wearable technologies, tangible interfaces, human-robot collaboration, evolving tools, processes and interactions, virtual reality, the ubiquitous use of machine learning, and deep-learning algorithms. Such aspects are increasing the benefits of technology and opening the way toward technical breakthroughs, and have led to the emergence of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which can be seen as systems of systems, requiring collaboration among different disciplines such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science for their realization. To enable the full potential of a CPS and generate a substantial competitive advantage, however, the service perspective cannot be neglected. Servitization of product offerings has recently accumulated in so-called productservice systems (PSSs), which describe the integrated development, realization, and provisioning of productservice bundles as a solution for customers. Thus, it is more and more important to consider both the technological and service aspects early in the development process. An integration of the two concepts will lead to product-service bundles provided on a cyberphysical basis, creating cyber-physical product-service systems (CPSSs). To base these complex systems on stakeholder needs and allow a successful and dynamic change to CPSSs in industry, multi-disciplinary requirements engineering (RE) for the hardware, software, and service components is a key aspect. The objective of this paper is to provide an introduction to the CPSS concept, understand its application in an industrial case, and elaborate on the specific challenges for systems engineering, focusing on the RE process. © 2017, Fuji Technology Press.

2017,Amorphous transdisciplinary service systems,"Amorphous transdisciplinary system is the application of backend object-oriented service providers - local/remote objects - having independent limited computational functionalities - provider services - that dynamically actualise frontend service-oriented microservices and macroservices. A microservice binds to a single provider and executes a single provider service. A macroservice by contrast is a compound service request comprising of microservices and other macroservices with service fidelities and metafidelities. Macroservices express dynamic collaborations of large number of provider services (applications, tools, and utilities) with emergent multifidelity management. This type of agile service aggregation is often referred to as a system of systems. A metafidelity - fidelity of fidelities - is used by a fidelity management system to morph a macroservice for evolving collaboration of provider services at runtime. The presented amorphous transdisciplinary approach provides service-oriented modelling or programming, or both (mogramming) with a corresponding service-oriented operating system. The operating system runs amorphous frontend macroservices and dynamically manages its service processor - corresponding collaborations of backend service providers.

2017,Evolution Model of Equipment Support System of Systems Based on Complex Network Theory,"The equipment support system of systems (SOS) architecture plays a decisive role in the effectiveness and adaptability of SOS, and the evolution model is a key technology to construct the equipment support SOS architecture. An improved evolution model of equipment support SOS based on the multi-weighted network is proposed for the heterogeneity of the entities in the equipment support SOS and the impact of the support mission requirements on the architecture evolution. The network characteristics of equipment support SOS is analyzed, the complex network theory is introduced to construct the initial weighted network model of the equipment support SOS, and the network evaluation indexes are presented. On this basis, the network evolution rule and the improved evolution model are proposed. In the weighted network model, the support mission requirements are abstracted as the network nodes, and the uncertainty of mission requirements is described by a quaternion, and the fitness index is used to link support mission requirements with the SOS architecture. The heterogeneity of network nodes is characterized by the type and support capability of nodes, and regarded as a major factor in the evolution process. The simulation experimental results show that the improved model can be used to determine the influence of the support mission on the evolution process, improve the adaptability of SOS architecture to the mission, and enhance the SOS effectiveness in a certain range. © 2017, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii.

2018,"Integrating in-vehicle, vehicle-To-vehicle, and intelligent roadway systems","With the inexorable push toward autonomous road vehicles by companies such as Tesla Motors and Google, there is an urgent need to make roadways 'smart' and to connect vehicles' computer systems to one another and to their surroundings, infrastructure, and ecosystem. The effective integration of these systems is a major challenge for companies and government agencies. We examine the state of current and evolving systems and communications with respect to in-vehicle (IV), vehicle-To-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-To-surroundings (V2S), vehicle-To-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-To-ecosystem (V2E). We define the term 'surroundings' as the immediate vicinity of a vehicle; 'infrastructure' as the local area, such as a municipality or nearby countryside; and 'ecosystem' as distant facilities, such as the Internet, the Cloud, and call centers. We postulate that, for self-driving road vehicles to be fully effective, these efforts must progress together, and selected approaches must be standardized, preferably globally, so that diverse systems can be readily integrated into systems-of-systems. Failure to make such advances across the board will hamper the design, development, and deployment of the many safety-critical systems in need of integration. We suggest how to introduce such technologies, taking into consideration the latest advances and the cost and ease of implementation and support. © 2018 WIT Press.",10.2495/DNE-V13-N1-23-38,,scopus

2018,Cyber physical systems implementation for asset management improvement: A framework for the transition,"The transformation of the industry due to recent technologies introduction is an evolving process whose engines are competitiveness and sustainability, understood in its broadest sense (environmental, economic and social). This process is facing, due to the current state of scientific and technological development, a new challenge yet even more important: the transition from discrete technological solutions that respond to isolated problems, to a global conception where the assets, plant, processes and engineering systems are conceived, designed and operated as an integrated complex unit. This vision is evolving besides a set of concepts that are, in some way, to guide this development: Smart Factories, Cyber-Physical Systems, Factory of the Future or Industry 4.0, are examples. The full integration of the operation and maintenance (O&M) processes in the production systems is a key topic within this new paradigm. Not only that, this evolution necessarily results in the emergence of new processes and needs of O&M, i.e. also, the O&M will undergo a profound transformation. The transition from actual isolated production assets to such Industry 4.0 with CPS is far from easy. This document presents a proposal to develop such transition adapting one iteration of the Model of Maintenance Management (MMM) integrated into ISO 55000 to the complexity of incorporating “System of Systems” CPSs maintenance.

2016,A multi-objective military system of systems architecting problem with inflexible and flexible systems: formulation and solution methods,"System of systems (SoS) architecting is the process of bringing together and connecting a set of systems so that the collection of the systems, i.e., the SoS is equipped with a set of required capabilities. A system is defined as inflexible in case it contributes to the SoS with all of the capabilities it can provide. On the other hand, a flexible system can collaborate with the SoS architect in the capabilities it will provide. In this study, we formulate and analyze a SoS architecting problem representing a military mission planning problem with inflexible and flexible systems as a multi-objective mixed-integer-linear optimization model. We discuss applications of an exact and an evolutionary method for generating and approximating the Pareto front of this model, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a decomposition approach, which decomposes the problem into smaller sub-problems by adding equality constraints, to improve both the exact and the evolutionary methods. Results from a set of numerical studies suggest that the proposed decomposition approach reduces the computational time for generating the exact Pareto front as well as it reduces the computational time for approximating the Pareto front while not resulting in a worse approximated Pareto front. The proposed decomposition approach can be easily used for different problems with different exact and heuristic methods and thus is a promising tool to improve the computational time of solving multi-objective combinatorial problems.

2017,Generational evolution in complex engineered systems,"Systems need to evolve to what is required and needed functionally. Looking at how each generation of a system changes as an evolutionary process, one can see correlations with the natural evolution process. Using nature as a guide, biological models may be a means to assess an engineered system and propose anticipatory changes (evolutions) to a current system to create the next generation. This idea of systems generational evolution may provide insight into the design process of multigenerational systems to be more adaptable to changing technology. Fundamental areas of research for support in this topic are biological evolutionary mathematical models and system of systems classification. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

2016,Interfaces in evolving cyber-physical systems-of-systems,"In the past twenty years the view on how we engineer, operate and evolve independently owned and managed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in order to realize and optimize complex economical processes has started to change. Advances in telecommunications and automation accompanied by standardization efforts resulted in sophisticated cross-domain information and communication technologies (e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) [2, 9], elastic processing and storage clouds, Web Services) that allow for the integration of more and more existing and previously technologically isolated CPSs. These legacy systems became cooperating Constituent Systems (CSs) of evolving Cyber-Physical Systems-of-Systems (CPSoSs) and – by their physical and cyber interaction – give rise to new emergent services that cannot be realized by any single or small number of CSs alone. © The Author(s) 2016.",10.1007/978-3-319-47590-5_2,,scopus; springerlink
2017,Knowledge amplification by structured expert randomization-KASERs in SoS design,"The U.S. Army needs robotic combat vehicles that can autonomously navigate the battlefield and carry out planned missions that necessarily embody unplanned details. On one end of the spectrum lie the simple insect-like robots that have been popularized by Brooks at MIT [1]. Their simple behaviors can be evolved much in the same manner as a simple program can be created through the use of chance alone. Of course, more complex behaviors cannot be tractably evolved, because the search space here grows exponentially. What is needed are heuristics to guide the evolutionary process. We can, of course, program search strategies and have indeed programmed robots to perform a myriad of complex functions-from the robot Manny’s (U.S. Army) ability to walk the battlefield to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). What is needed is a means to program more complex and reliable functionality for constant cost. That is, a system of systems (SoS) is needed. For example, one can program a robotic vehicle to sense and avoid an obstacle on the right, say. But then, what is the cost of programming the same robot to sense and avoid an obstacle on the left? It should be less, and is to some extent if object-oriented component-based programs are written. The problem here, though, is that the cost is front loaded. The programmer needs to know a priori most of the domain symmetries if he or she is to capture them in the form of objects. A better solution is to do for symbolic programming what fuzzy logic did for Boolean logic [2,3]. That is, we need the programmer to be able to constrain the robot’s behavior in the form generalized actions. Then, instances of these generalizations constitute the desired program. Even search-control heuristics can be acquired through the exercise of this paradigm. Instead of programming the robot to do a specific action, we program the robot to (heuristically) search a space of actions for one or more that is consistent with environmental constraints. The writing of such programs is easier for the human, and the constraints that instantiate them serve to render the search space tractable for the machine. © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1201/9781420065893,,scopus
2018,Leadership and foresight in complex system governance,"Complex system governance (CSG) is an emerging field focused on addressing complex systems and related problems. CSG is related to system of systems engineering (SoSE) in that both are concerned with integration of multiple complex systems with the desired outcome of capabilities beyond those available by the individual systems. Specifically, CSG focuses on the design, evolution, and execution of (metasystem) functions essential for system operations and survival (viability). Included are functions for monitoring the system's environment and developing reactions to changes encountered therein. Foresight is a process to expand awareness and clarify emerging conditions. The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence foresight might have on the functions performed by the CSG environment monitoring and metasystem development/evolution subsystems, and the role of leadership in designing and enabling the means for those functions to be performed.

2018,"Development of future return period stillwater floodplains for the coasts of Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida panhandle","Rising seas increase the exposure, vulnerability, and thus the risk associated with storm surge flowing across the coastal floodplain (Passeri et al. 2015). This is especially true across low-gradient coastal landscapes such as Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. The extent and depth of flooding will be exasperated over the long term by morphologic changes to the shoreline, dunes and barrier islands (Plant et al. 2016, Passeri et al. 2016), marsh evolution (Alizad et al. 2016, Kidwell et al. 2017, Morris et al. 2016), and land use and land cover changes (Bilskie et al. 2014 & 2016). This presentation will describe how to incorporate biogeophysical impacts of climate change into future tide and surge models. A methodology will be presented (Bilskie et al. 2018) to down select a suite of synthetic storms from recent flood insurance studies to force hurricane storm surge models that represent present day and future changes to the coastal landscape under four sea level rise (SLR) scenarios of low (0.2 m), intermediate-low (0.5 m), intermediate-high (1.2 m), and high (2.0 m). Results of peak storm surge are used to compute the 100-year and 500-year return period floodplain and stillwater surge heights for each SLR scenario. Details on the vast new regions that become part of the 100- and 500-year floodplains by the end of the century will be discussed. Comparisons and contrasts with present day return period stillwater floodplains will be drawn. For example, throughout most of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, the present day 500-year return period event, in terms of inundation area and volume, becomes a 100-year event with just 0.5 m of SLR. Results indicate the need to take a system of systems approach to assess the coastal dynamics of sea level rise. The system of systems approach used herein and future enhancements to it will be elaborated. Transdisciplinary outcomes from this research are helping plan and prepare for the effects of SLR across the northern Gulf of Mexico and other low-gradient coastal landscapes (DeLorme et al. 2016). The importance of the involvement of stakeholders from across the northern Gulf of Mexico throughout the duration of the project will be highlighted. Finally, how the stakeholder involvement is worked into the system of systems approach will be discussed. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved.",,,scopus
2018,Required changes in requirements engineering approaches for socio-cyber-physical systems,"Requirements engineering has been mainly focused on software development, which represents relatively homogenous, stable and predictable cyber space. But even there, problems in requirements (e.g., changing, missing or irrelevant requirements) are considered as main reasons for project failure. Entering a new era of socio-cyber-physical systems, which are complex, heterogeneous systems of systems, will make requirements engineering even more challenging. Not only it is a standard practice that requirements change and evolve, and new requirements emerge frequently during the system life cycle. In socio-cyber-physical systems, requirements cannot be defined just for the cyber space, but must cover also the socio and physical spaces. There are also highly complex interrelationships, interactions and impacts between components of systems that can lead to unexpected and even unacceptable consequences in system structure and behaviour. One of the promising approaches supporting adaptability and emergency of systems is continuous requirements engineering, based on agility, flexibility and emergence. Therefore it is necessary to identify gaps in existing requirements engineering practices with respect to socio-cyber-physical systems and to propose required adjustments and enhancements in requirements engineering process.

2017,Automating the space architecture definition and assessment process,"Though considered “rocket science” by many, much of the work to define and assess space architecture options can be completely automated, thereby enabling many more options to be devised and assessed in less time. The Adaptable System Design and Analysis (ASDA) tool can effectively automate parts of “development planning”, which in recent years has been stressed to produce decision quality products due to shortage of resources. Currently the development planning for systems of systems is “hit or miss” and thus less likely to identify the best options to pursue in a cost constrained environment. This paper describes the progress in creating a rapid turn, low cost design space to assemble architectures from launch vehicles, satellite buses and instruments, into larger systems of systems and find those best options. This type of tooling or framework has been discussed before within the community, but has not been used for planning and programming decisions across the entire AFSPC and SMC portfolio. This approach addresses the key obstacles to the acceptance of an automated process for AFSPC and SMC and offers the strategy to transition the effort into the AFSPC and SMC portfolio. Key ideas to be covered include: how to obtain personnel to run the design space, how to affordably update the information in the data bases and assure that the framework itself is maintained. These issues are shown to be solvable with existing resources within the USAF space community. The automated tooling can be used by the new Enterprise Systems Engineering Council efforts for devising cross enterprise evolution and providing the key injects for the AFSPC planning and programming efforts associated with the Integrated Planning Process in support of the Space Enterprise Vision. Other high fidelity tools and environments can be used at a lower price point if tools like ASDA are first used to cull down the trade space. In particular, the ASDA tooling should work synergistically with the Aerospace Corporation's Portfolio Decision Support Tool framework. The ASDA framework can be made to operate at different security levels to enable collaboration with many different parties. It is a lightweight framework which does not require special computational platforms. The entire tool can be written to a single CD/DVD disk. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.",10.2514/6.2017-5171,,scopus
2018,"An alternate view of the systems engineering""V"" in a model-based engineering environment","The iconic Systems Engineering “V” has served the aerospace and defense industry for over 25 years as a model of the product development process for complex systems. This familiar V model portrays the decomposition of requirements and design definition from the top level system or system of systems down to components and the resulting system integration and validation from components up to the end-user system. The V model originated at a time when engineering processes required manual handoffs and interfaces between disciplines by exchange of documents. Today, exponential improvements in computing technology allow engineers to dramatically increase the use of analytical models and simulations leading to the creation of digital twins of the physical systems. The Systems Engineering V model does not adequately describe this growing Model-Based Engineering (MBE) environment. A new MBE Diamond model is proposed to replace the V model to address the creation of digital twins as well as use of twins to design and optimize systems before the first physical item is built. This MBE Diamond is an evolution of the V model and retains much of the systems engineering approach while recognizing changes that are affecting both our engineering process and product design as we move into a model-based engineering era. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

2017,Resilience-based component importance and recovery strategy for system-of-systems,"System-of-systems (SoS) is always under the influence of both intra and extra disruptive events. SoS architecture is the foundation of SoS design and construction, whose resilience is not only an significant indicator to reflect the ability to recover from disruptions, but also an important embodiment of evolution of SoS. Based on resilience, an effective SoS architecture evaluation method was proposed to conduct component importance measures (CIMs). In the method, the resilience of SoS architecture was defined in detail, relevant mathematical models were built, and influence of performance loss and recovery time on component importance were comprehensively weighed. Then, according to analysis of various disruptive events and recovery strategy, an optimized model for SoS resilience based on CIMs was proposed, and the optimized result of the proposed model on recovery capability of SoS was mainly analyzed. Finally, an example of evaluating resilience of SoS was introduced to validate the availability of the proposed model and method, and the final result shows that the optimized recovery strategy contributes to improving the recovery efficiency of SoS greatly. © 2017, Editorial Board of JBUAA.

The relation between informatics science and engineering and the organization’s business or control processes automation, or services provisioning and adaptation, has demonstrated to be difficult to converge to a common understanding of clear computational responsibility borders. Existing approaches and standards fail to be complete with respect to establishing a landscape of informatics technology under vendor agnostic model (lock-in free).

2018,HyVar: Scalable Hybrid Variability for Distributed Evolving Software Systems,"The HyVar project (www.hyvar-project.eu/) proposes a development framework for continuous and individualized evolution of distributed software applications running on remote devices in heterogeneous environments, focusing on the automotive domain. The framework combines variability modeling and software reuse from software product lines with formal methods and software upgrades and can be integrated in existing software development processes. HyVar’s objectives are: (O1) To develop a Domain Specific Variability Language (DSVL) and tool chain to support software variability for highly distributed applications; (O2) to develop a cloud infrastructure that exploits software variability as described in the DSVL to track the software configurations deployed on remote devices and to enable (i) the collection of data from the devices to monitor their behavior; and (ii) secure and efficient customized updates; (O3) to develop a technology for over-the-air updates of distributed applications, which enables continuous software evolution after deployment on complex remote devices that incorporate a system of systems; and (O4) to test HyVar’s approach as described in the above objectives in an industry-led demonstrator to assess in quantifiable ways its benefits. The end of the project is approaching and we are close to reaching all the objectives. In this paper, we present the integrated tool chain, which combines formal reuse through software product lines with commonly used industrial practices, and supports the development and deployment of individualized software adaptations. We also describe the main benefits for the stakeholders involved. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/978-3-319-79090-9_12,,scopus
2017,A robust portfolio optimization approach using parametric piecewise linear models of system dependencies,"""System of Systems"" architecture problems can be very challenging due to the large number of systems involved and complex interdependencies that exist between and among them. The high number of decision variables and interactions presents the need for an appropriate collection of methods, processes, and tools that can help practitioners deal with such complexities and answer key questions that typically arise when evolving an architecture. In this chapter, we build on prior work toward developing a System-of-Systems Analytic Workbench and propose a combined use of two of the workbench tools, namely, the Robust Portfolio Optimization and Systems Operational Dependency Analysis tools. The purpose of the combination is to more explicitly introduce the dependency modeling capabilities of one with the computationally efficient decision-support capabilities of the other.

2018,Modeling Freight Transportation as a System-of-Systems to Determine Adoption of Emerging Vehicle Technologies,"The U.S. freight transportation system is a complex agglomeration of interacting systems that includes line-haul and urban delivery vehicles, inter and intra-city highways, and support infrastructure. In order to project the evolution of the system and the market penetration of emerging freight vehicle technologies, it is important to model the aforementioned interconnections, public adoption preferences, and operational and policy constraints that impact it. In this paper, we propose a system-of-systems engineering approach to define the scope of influential mechanisms and abstract an appropriate model of the U.S. freight transportation system with focus on a line-haul scenario. Implementation over a multi-city network is posed as a constrained mixed-integer linear program. The allocation and operation of three vehicle architectures - conventional diesel, diesel platooning, and battery electric - are optimized over a multi-city network to minimize the fleet-wide total cost of ownership over a twenty-year time horizon. We examine the effects of projected changes in energy cost, freight demand, and hours-of-service regulations on the annual market share evolution of these technologies. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784481547.015,,scopus; webofscience
2018,Space2030 and Space 4.0: Synergies for capacity building in the XXI century,"New innovation models are increasingly spread across sectors and disciplines, including Space, which is becoming an integral part of many societal activities (e.g. telecoms, weather, climate change and environmental monitoring, civil protection, infrastructures, transportation and navigation, healthcare and education). Space 4.0 ambitions are to place space at the heart of the successful evolution of Europe and the full implementation of the United Nations Agenda 2030 worldwide. The outcomes of the conference â€œSpace2030 and Space 4.0: synergies for capacity building in the XXI centuryâ€, recently co-organized by the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), point to the timeliness of a fresh look at the wider perspectives and strategies to be implemented in future space programmes. The paper summarizes these findings and recommendations involving stakeholders and representatives of civil society, mapping out available options and identifying the ideal conditions for their successful implementation. Innovative frameworks, partnerships and collaborations in this ecosystem are explored, posing special attention to improving the dialogue with civil society and other sectors, to make them aware of the potential of space, and to the creation of new mechanisms to identify, collect and process user needs, in order to design, implement and fully exploit future space programmes. In this context, potential synergies between the UN agenda Space2030 and the ESA Space 4.0 strategy are identified, focusing on four thematic priorities of UNISPACE+50: Global partnership in space exploration and innovation; Strengthened space cooperation for global health; International cooperation towards low emission and resilient societies; Capacity building for the twenty first century. Through these themes, the interplay and dependencies amongst key actors are identified, and a special emphasis is placed on future approaches of the diverse groups of stakeholders involved, leveraging the existing space infrastructure, institutions and networks while reinforcing and expanding their scope and effectiveness in ensuring that space becomes an important driver for sustainable development. For example, future integrated services will capture new citizen needs and target sustainable development goals, creating unprecedented opportunities for Europe worldwide. This will be enabled by Copernicus, Galileo and by the emergence of new satcom infrastructures for 5G, serving new markets by providing broadband connectivity to rural areas. Space is therefore increasingly becoming the link among systems of systems, and its enabling function may represent a key element actively contributing to a sustainable future on Earth.

2018,China’s Vision of the Future Networked Battlefield: Emerging Military-Technological Challenges to the United States,"This chapter examines the intersection of China’s evolving C4ISR architecture with the cyber, space, and electronic warfare asymmetric challenges posed by China to the United States on the future network-centric battlefield. Compared to China’s conventional weapon systems, far less ink has been spilt on Chinese thinking in the development of the critical support architecture that enables and enhances China’s technologically advanced war-fighting capabilities. A central argument this chapter makes is that China’s war-fighting capabilities networked by C4ISR posed greater threats to the United States than the sum of their parts. It describes the contours of a discourse within the U.S. defense community that interpreted these ‘systems of systems’ as specifically designed to exploit U.S. military vulnerabilities in the Western Pacific. This emerging C4ISR military paradigm increased the incentives for both sides to strike first and preemptively against the other C4ISR systems, which during the Obama presidency perceptibly worsened strategic stabilizing in the Asia-Pacific. © 2018, The Author(s).",10.1007/978-3-319-75838-1_4,,scopus; springerlink

2018,Modelling and simulation of system-of-systems using P-systems theory,"This paper connects two independent fields of research - system-of-systems (SoS) and P-systems. P-systems, originally inspired by basic features of biological membranes, where objects are placed into compartments defined by a membrane structure, and evolve according to reaction rules. Systems that belong to a particular level in the hierarchy of a SoS are can be understood to be within a membrane of certain depth. Also, objects in P-systems evolve in a maximally parallel, non-deterministic manner, a preferred method of evolution for many intractable SoS problems. Transitions of individual systems to other systems, or to alternative configurations can be easily realised using the format of P-systems. By casting typical SoS problems into P-system representations, we demonstrate the ease of problem set up, and the possibility of solving commonly intractable SoS modelling and simulation problems in feasible time. An example problem involving communication between aircraft is studied to illustrate the applicability of P-systems theory to SoS.

2017,Resilient cyber-secure systems and system of systems: Implications for the Department of Defense,"Over the past two decades, the United States has continued to modify and improve upon its cyber strategy as a result of a constantly evolving and asymmetric cyber threat. As the dependency on networked systems and connectivity has increased, so have the complexity and vulnerability of these systems within US critical infrastructure. For this reason, resilience, affordability, and collaboration between the government and private industry will be imperative in maintaining the cyberspace advantage as cyber threats groups continue to target systems and system-of-systems (SoS) within the Department of Defense (DoD) (Syst Eng 15:95-107; Wheaton MJ (2016) Affordable resilient systems.

2018,An approach for system of systems requirements management,"Systems of Systems (SoS) are becoming more common in our society due to the diversity of stakeholders, heterogeneous technology, ubiquity, or large-scale networks involved in the development of software intensive systems. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in closing the gaps still existing in the System of Systems Engineering field, which is in constant growth due to its complexity. Most of these gaps are related to the SoS requirements management, the lack of well-defined and standardized methods and techniques for Requirements Engineering for SoS makes difficult the development and the evolution of the overall SoS. In this paper we propose an approach to requirements management for SoS through a process capable of organizing the work among stakeholders and managing changes in requirements, thus1 contributing to a more adaptable evolutionary development of the SoS.

2017,The design of a cloud-based tracker platform based on system-of-systems service architecture,"Devices embedded with position tracking facilities are now widely available, such as smartphones, smartwatches, vehicle location trackers, etc. However, data mining and advanced analytics are rarely bundled with these devices that limits their utility. In this paper, we present the design of a generic, programmable position tracking platform, namely CQtracker. In particular, this platform is incorporated with a cloud-based engine of advanced analytics. CQtracker is constructed based on a concept of system-of-systems service architecture to deliver data-system-as-a-service. It is designed for the consumption by a variety of spatio-temporal applications. Spatio-temporal data exhibit strong heterogeneous patterns, data sparseness and distribution skewness. Hence, they are difficult to analyze. CQtracker reveals relationships and structures from these data by self-regularized time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks. In addition, a Bayesian parameter estimation approach is applied to an epidemic model for outbreak predictions. Sample applications are presented in this paper, in which CQtracker successfully reveals the evolution of time-varying structures from traffic trajectories. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",10.1007/s10796-017-9768-9,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2017,Using evolutionary theory in studying the development of system of systems,"The paper describes a systems approach to study the evolution and development of a System of systems, particularly in military context. In this article, the System of systems is a socio-technical structure, where Information and Communication Technology is intertwined with human and other structural parts. Due to the interaction with the environment and between intertwined parts, System of systems is complex and dynamic in nature. Most of the system engineering or design methods tend to over-reduce the situation or over-emphasise some parts. When developing models describing the possible future states, Enterprise Architects struggle to analyse what future is practical to achieve. To overcome these challenges, a research method based on systems thinking is introduced. The foundation for the method was presented in Darwinian (1859) Theory of evolution. It is applied to technical systems by Mokyr (1998). Since the system in the Mokyr’s model was found too monolithic, Andriani’s and Carigani’s (2012) approach is applied to introduce modular design and innovation. Mokyr defines knowledge as underlying structure needed to design systems. Creating knowledge is extended using features of Choo’s (1998) model for Knowing Organisation. The extended model is tested with basic features presented in Bertalanffy’s (1968) general system theory. The model for the evolution of the socio-technical system of systems is corroborated with the use case in the military evolution of mechanised forces and manoeuvre tactics (Vego, 2007). The research model has been this far used in studying the capabilities of military command, control, communications, computing, and information. The business level studies have addressed the development of military knowledge management and the evolution of military training. The information level study has dealt with evolving military information management. All three studies provided tools for Enterprise Architects to do business level analyses both for the current and help in defining possible end states for strategies. © 2017 Academic Conferences Limited.

There is a need to model the constituent systems composing a SoS in order to allow the analysis of emergent behaviours at the SoS boundary. The Contract pattern allows the engineer to specify constrained behaviours to which constituent systems are required to conform in order to be a part of the SoS. However, the Contract pattern faces some limitations in terms of its accessibility and suitability for verifying contract compatibility. To address these deficiencies, we propose the enrichment of the Contract pattern, which hitherto has been defined using SysML and the COMPASS Modelling Language (CML), by utilising SysML and Object Constraint Language (OCL). In addition, we examine the potential of interface automata, a notation for improving loose coupling between interfaces of constituent systems defined according to the contract, as a means of enabling the verification of contract compatibility. The approach is demonstrated using a case study in audio/video content streaming. © O. Faldik, R. Payne, J. Fitzgerald & B.

2017,Zachman framework in the agile digital transformation,"Emergent behavior is behavior of a system that does not depend on its individual parts, but on their relationships to one another. Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Ultimately, SysML and UML should be integrated with the agent-based model. An example with the collaborative engineering services for the global automotive supply chain is hereby described. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.",10.3233/978-1-61499-779-5-67,,scopus; webofscience
2017,Order beyond chaos: Introducing the notion of generation to characterize the continuously evolving implementations of cyber-physical systems,"Authors belonging to different institutions ('schools') of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) research and development report on largely different objectives, underpin their work with different theories and methodologies, and target characteristics which can actually better characterize other categories and families of engineered systems. This has resulted in an ontological chaos. Therefore, our research addressed the question: What exists in the form of past, current and future CPSs? Our hypothesis has been that we can have an ordered picture on the landscape of CPSs by introducing the notion of system generation. Generation is a structural term defined as a 'technological/engineering cohort' of different individual manifestation of systems that reflect genotypic features of ancestor systems belonging to the same category, but deviates from them with regards to their phenotypic features. Based on our literature findings, we have defined five generations of CPSs, which could be differentiated based on: (i) the level of self-intelligence, and (ii) the level of self-organization. The zeroth generation includes look-Alikes and partial implementations of CPS. The 1G-CPSs include systems with self-regulation and self-Tuning capabilities, while the 2G-CPSs are capable to operationalize self-Awareness and selfadaptation. The 3G-CPSs are equipped with the capabilities of self-cognizance and self-evolution. According to our reasoning model, only the fourth generation of CPSs is supposed to achieve self-consciousness and self-reproduction in the form of system of systems. The paper analyses the major paradigmatic characteristics of these generations. It also provides an outlook to the trends that may have strong influence on the introduced generations of CPSs. © 2017 ASME.",10.1115/DETC2017-67082,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-abstract/IDETC-CIE2017/V001T02A015/259144,scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2017,HyWare: A hybrid workflow language for research E-infrastructures,"Research e-infrastructures are ""systems of systems"", patchworks of tools, services and data sources, evolving over time to address the needs of the scientific process. Accordingly, in such environments, researchers implement their scientific processes by means of workflows made of a variety of actions, including for example usage of web services, download and execution of shared software libraries or tools, or local and manual manipulation of data. Although scientists may benefit from sharing their scientific process, the heterogeneity underpinning e-infrastructures hinders their ability to represent, share and eventually reproduce such workflows. This work presents HyWare, a language for representing scientific process in highly-heterogeneous e-infrastructures in terms of so-called hybrid workflows. HyWare lays in between ""business process modeling languages"", which offer a formal and high-level description of a reasoning, protocol, or procedure, and ""workflow execution languages"", which enable the fully automated execution of a sequence of computational steps via dedicated engines. © 2017 Leonardo Candela, Fosca Giannotti, Valerio Grossi, Paolo Manghi and Roberto Trasarti.",10.1045/january2017-candela,,scopus
2018,The ESOC end-to-end ground segment reference facility,"The Ground Segment for Mission Operations is a complex System of Systems, including a significant variety of complex elements, often generic and reused across missions, following adaptation to meet mission or family of missions specific requirements and configuration. For such Systems of Systems, the availability of a reference environment where individual ground segment components can be deployed and tested throughout their lifecycle, both at subsystem level and in integrated test chains up to a complete End-to-End Ground Segment, is critical. Also the representativeness of such an environment is critical, in particular the representativeness of the test scenarios with respect to the end-user use cases.

2016,"Digitising the industry internet of things connecting the physical, digital and virtual worlds","This book provides an overview of the current Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, ranging from the research, innovation and development priorities to enabling technologies in a global context. A successful deployment of IoT technologies requires integration on all layers, be it cognitive and semantic aspects, middleware components, services, edge devices/machines and infrastructures. It is intended to be a standalone book in a series that covers the Internet of Things activities of the IERC - Internet of Things European Research Cluster from research to technological innovation, validation and deployment. The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European Research Cluster and the IoT European Platform Initiative (IoT-EPI) and presents global views and state of the art results on the challenges facing the research, innovation, development and deployment of IoT in the next years. The IoT is bridging the physical world with virtual world and requires sound information processing capabilities for the ""digital shadows"" of these real things. The research and innovation in nanoelectronics, semiconductor, sensors/actuators, communication, analytics technologies, cyber-physical systems, software, swarm intelligent and deep learning systems are essential for the successful deployment of IoT applications. The emergence of IoT platforms with multiple functionalities enables rapid development and lower costs by offering standardised components that can be shared across multiple solutions in many industry verticals. The IoT applications will gradually move from vertical, single purpose solutions to multi-purpose and collaborative applications interacting across industry verticals, organisations and people, being one of the essential paradigms of the digital economy. Many of those applications still have to be identified and involvement of end-users including the creative sector in this innovation is crucial. The IoT applications and deployments as integrated building blocks of the new digital economy are part of the accompanying IoT policy framework to address issues of horizontal nature and common interest (i.e. privacy, end-to-end security, user acceptance, societal, ethical aspects and legal issues) for providing trusted IoT solutions in a coordinated and consolidated manner across the IoT activities and pilots. In this, context IoT ecosystems offer solutions beyond a platform and solve important technical challenges in the different verticals and across verticals. These IoT technology ecosystems are instrumental for the deployment of large pilots and can easily be connected to or build upon the core IoT solutions for different applications in order to expand the system of use and allow new and even unanticipated IoT end uses. Technical topics discussed in the book include: Introduction. Digitising industry and IoT as key enabler in the new era of Digital Economy. IoT Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. IoT in the digital industrial context: Digital Single Market. Integration of heterogeneous systems and bridging the virtual, digital and physical worlds. Federated IoT platforms and interoperability. Evolution from intelligent devices to connected systems of systems by adding new layers of cognitive behaviour, artificial intelligence and user interfaces. Innovation through IoT ecosystems.

2018,Formally describing self-organizing architectures for systems-of-systems on the internet-of-things,"Nowadays, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) enables the engineering of Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems (SoS), which are opportunistically created for achieving specified missions in specific operational environments. A challenging issue in the architectural design of SoS on IoT is to conceive concepts and mechanisms for describing how an SoS architecture is able to create, on the fly, emergent behaviors from elementary IoT systems/devices. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the theory of self-organization, which makes possible that, in an SoS, its constituent systems spontaneously create and maintain a valid SoS architecture enabling the evolutionary development of the required emergent behavior to fulfill the specified SoS mission. In particular, it describes how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), based on the novel π-Calculus for SoS, was enhanced to support the architectural description of self-organizing SoSs on the IoT, upwardly causing SoS emergent behaviors at run-time. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_2,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar
2018,"MAD-VR: Machine learning, analysis, and design in virtual reality","As the modern battlespace continues to evolve, reliance on relatively few, dominant weapon systems is rapidly becoming infeasible. New weapon systems must be able to communicate and coordinate with other actors in the mission arena to achieve warfighter objectives. This is creating an explosion of complexity and data/information processing burden that hampers the warfighter's ability to effectively operate. This emerging complexity is in turn driving the need for sophisticated autonomous and semi-autonomous systems, as well as adaptive real-time filters and decision-assist mechanisms. Machine learning, Analysis, and Design in Virtual Reality (MAD-VR) is a tool to facilitate the design, proof-of-concept, and initial testing of algorithms for autonomy, information fusion, and machine learning. Designed as a next-generation front-end for high-speed simulations, it specifically addresses the need for a high-level, system-of-systems environment within which to evaluate the battlespace impact of these critical algorithms. Engineers and technicians will be able to observe the execution of new control systems, sensor data, and decision support systems in a high-fidelity simulation incorporating a diverse breadth of weapons and platforms, all working together to achieve mission success. Additionally, the warfighter will be able to use this tool directly to help with mission planning and optimization, as a means of examining outcomes in a Monte Carlo style of analysis. © 2018 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2305020,,scopus; webofscience

2015,A robust portfolio optimization approach to system of system architectures,"The realization of military capability as a System of Systems (SoS), presents significant development challenges across technical, operational and programmatic dimensions. In particular, tools for deciding how to form and evolve SoS which consider performance and risk are lacking. This research leverages tools from financial engineering and operations research perspectives in portfolio optimization to assist decision making in this setting. Our approach facilitates evolutions of SoS architecture through a framework that supports architecture selection at a given decision-epoch of the evolutionary process. The approach models hierarchies of interdependent systems as generic nodes on a network that, subject to connectivity and compatibility constraints, work cohesively to fulfill overarching capability objectives. A robust portfolio algorithm is employed to address inherent real world issues of data uncertainty, inter-nodal performance and developmental risk. A naval warfare scenario illustrates application of the method to find ""portfolios"" of systems from a candidate list of available systems. Results show how the framework effectively reduces the combinatorial complexity of tradespace exploration (e.g., connectivity rules, feasibility of solutions, optimality of solutions) by allowing the optimization problem to handle the mathematically intensive aspects of the decision-making process. As a result, human decision-makers can focus on choosing the appropriate weights for risk aversion in making final decisions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21302,,scopus; wiley; webofscience

2016,Model-oriented systems engineering science: A unifying framework for traditional and complex systems,"Systems engineering (SE) is experiencing a significant expansion that encompasses increasingly complex systems. However, a common body of knowledge on how to apply complex systems engineering (CSE) has yet to be developed. A combination of people and other autonomous agents, crossing organization boundaries and continually changing, these hybrid systems are less predictable while being more self-organizing and adaptive than traditional systems. The growing pains of this evolution and the ever-widening reach of SE technology require an effective foundation for integrating traditional and complex engineering methods, addressing machine and human interaction, as well as scaling up and down, from nano scale to the macro system-of-systems level. Model-oriented Systems Engineering Science: A Unifying Framework for Traditional and Complex Systems addresses solutions to that expansion and integration problem. This text takes advantage of better-understood systems science (SS) to support the transition, identifying and using commonalities between complex systems and other sciences, such as biology, sociology, cognitive science, organizational theory, and computational science. The author defines Model-oriented Systems Engineering Science (MOSES), an organized system that selects appropriate information from these disciplines and unifies it into a coherent framework. The result is a seamless approach to the class of systems across the extended scope of the new SE-a foundation upon which to develop an enhanced and unified SE. Modeling orientation (MO) provides a common perspective on the entire SES/SE enterprise, including all supporting sciences, engineering for the full range of traditional, complex, and hybrid systems, and their management. This book extends existing modeling approaches into an MO that views all science artifacts and engineering artifacts as models of systems. It organizes them into a virtual structured repository called the ""SE model space""-effectively a container for the accumulating body of SE and SES knowledge in the form of models and patterns. By organizing and integrating all these elements into a common framework, the author makes the material not only easily accessible but also immediately applicable, and provides a well-grounded basis for future growth and evolution of the SE discipline. © 2009 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

2016,From data to processes - Use of modeling and simulation in healthcare,"Widespread adoption of HealthIT and eHealth systems has resulted in exponential growth of health related data that can be computationally processed and analyzed. Many healthcare organizations are adopting computational data analysis techniques and integrating results into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems for improving care delivery. However, data analysis alone cannot give insight into healthcare systems that are rapidly evolving into complex and dynamic system of systems. Every data is produced and/or consumed by an underlying process. Thus, to improve healthcare from the perspective of cost and patient safety, we also need approaches for modeling and analyzing possibly concurrent processes with constraints on resources and exhibiting synchronous and asynchronous interactions.

2015,Simulation-based analysis of reconfigurable system of system Network topologies for resilience using Bayesian Networks,"An emerging understanding of resilient systems is as a management principle or framework allowing for reconfiguration or adaptation in the face of threats or shocks. This is a new approach engineered system resilience: the more traditional approach is that systems may focus on resistance to threats, and speedy recovery if vulnerabilities are breached. This notion can potentially integrate interdisciplinary research currently pursued in systems engineering, design theory, infrastructure risk analysis, and statistical learning to create an approach that permits both evaluation of system resilience and also the value of system evolvability in the face of operational hazards. In prior work, a vision for reconfigurable systems based on Bayesian Networks was articulated but not tested or demonstrated. In this paper, we demonstrate a Bayesian Network inspired approach to measuring the value of re-configurability in systems of systems that can be represented in directed acyclic graphs using a simulation-based approach. For the purpose of our investigation, re-configurability means that a system can adapt its structure to structural failures in either system components or links between components. The latter is called structural flexibility, whereas the former is called functional flexibility. Undirected Bayesian Networks are used to structure the relationships between the subsystem components, and the graphical model is then used in conjunction with concepts from functional dependency network theory to evaluate the response the system under updated configurations.",,,scopus

With the exponential advancement of technology, unconventional sources of generation, storage and microturbines have been enhanced. The microgrid has paved its way into distributed generation and looks promising for future prospects. A review of microgrid architectures and models is presented in this study. Various control schemes devised for microgrids are also reviewed. The concept of SoSs is introduced and its applications are discussed.

2015,Linking the cyber and biological worlds: The ensemble is the function,"Mark Weiser in 1991 set the vision for ubiquitous computing: “The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.”[1]. Ubiquitous computing in his vision is embedded in the world around us or over our body via sensor networks accessed through intelligent interfaces: “Its highest ideal is to make a computer so embedded, so fitting, so natural, that we use it without even thinking about it.”[2]. He meant to reposition the center of our world by moving towards human-centered computing, where technology assists us adapting to human needs and preferences while remaining in the background, silent until required. Weiser predicted three ages of computing technology: themainframe age when many people shared a computer; the personal computer age when one person has one computer; and the ubiquitous computing age when each person shares many computers via a rich interconnect fabric. The consequence of this evolution of computing is a change in how people can interact with technology: a more natural way of using the power of networked sensing and computing systems. In the ubiquitous computing world, people are connected not just to the Internet or other computers, but to places, other people, even to everyday objects and things. Indeed the frontier of research is very much related to this vision: Internet of Things, Systems of Systems, and Swarms are all different facets of this encompassing vision, albeit each theme emphasizes one particular aspect. The increasing maturity, performance, and miniaturization of processors, networking technologies, memory, displays, and sensors is enabling a move towards pervasive computing, ubiquitous connectivity, and more adaptable interfaces that are sensitive and responsive. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",10.1017/CBO9781139629539.051,,scopus
2016,Computational intelligence based complex adaptive system-of-system architecture evolution strategy,"There is a constant challenge to incorporate new systems and upgrade existing systems under threats, constrained budget and uncertainty into systems of systems (SoS). It is necessary for program managers to be able to assess the impacts of future technology and stakeholder changes. This research helps analyze sequential decisions in an evolving SoS architecture through three key features: SoS architecture generation, assessment and implementation through negotiation. Architectures are generated using evolutionary algorithms and assessed using type II fuzzy nets. The approach accommodates diverse stakeholder views, converting them to key performance parameters (KPPs) for architecture assessment. It is not possible to implement an acknowledged SoS architecture without persuading the systems to participate. A negotiation model is proposed to help the SoS manger adapt his strategy based on system owners’ behavior. Viewpoints of multiple stakeholders are aggregated to assess the overall mission effectiveness of an architecture against the overarching objectives. A search and rescue (SAR) example illustrates application of the method. Future research might include group decision making for evaluating architectures. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",10.1007/978-3-319-26109-6_9,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

2016,Application of Multidisciplinary Systems-of-Systems Optimization to an Aircraft Design Problem,"A generic mathematical formulation for Systems-of-Systems (SoS) optimization problems is presented. SoS optimization problems resemble the structure of a tree of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) problems with additional unique features. The framework for solving such problems involves features from evolutionary computing, platform-based design, and evolving design spaces. One important aspect of SoS Engineering, often overlooked, is the role it plays in improving the design of individual systems. In this vein, this work has sought to exemplify such a synergistic approach for aircraft design. A large-scale SoS optimization problem for designing noise-optimal aircraft and improved procedures for the approach phase is studied.

2016,Digital communications and information systems,"Introduction: Digital communications and information systems infrastructure is comprised of a variety of communication and computation systems which provide the transmission, processing and storage of digital information. This includes: (i) legacy and fibre-optic cable networks; (ii) mobile, satellite and wireless networks; and (iii) data storage and processing centres. The acronym ICT is often used to describe these systems, though in other contexts ICT can refer to a much broader class of information and communications technologies. Here we use the shorthand ICT to refer to digital communications and information infrastructure systems. In comparison to other physical infrastructure sectors, ICT is relatively new and very rapidly evolving, so is less completely understood from a system-of-systems perspective. ICT infrastructure has become increasingly embedded in nearly all economic and social activities, including for operation of other infrastructure networks. Because of the complexity and rapid innovation in ICT systems, their future is highly uncertain and analysing the systems’ prospective direction is challenging. Yet, issues surrounding digital connectivity are high on the global policy agenda. In many advanced economies in Europe, North America and beyond, significant increases in ICT capacity have been delivered by inducing competition within industry combined with a light-touch, market-led regulatory approach. Innovation has provided new technologies and has helped serve growing consumer demand, which is itself largely driven by innovations in consumer technologies and business practices. Globally, the telecommunications sector has increased dramatically over the past decade to serve almost three billion Internet users, amounting to over 40% of the world's population (ITU, 2014a). Investment in competitive markets by network operators is underpinned by analysis comparing prospective revenues with investment costs (Tselekounis and Varoutas, 2013) so is determined by population density, topology and the capital cost of new technologies (Gotz, 2013). Population density is an important factor in serving local telecommunication markets because, like other infrastructure systems, large fixed-capital investments need to be spread over many consumers with the purchasing power to acquire service subscriptions. However, if left to its own devices the market would likely be considered to be socially unjust and not provide all the potential welfare benefits, as the majority of investment would likely flow into pockets of dense, wealthy and well-educated urban areas. This would particularly leave remote rural or other uneconomically viable locations at a severe disadvantage. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",10.1017/CBO9781107588745.010,,scopus
2016,Software architecture challenges and emerging research in software-intensive systems-of-systems,"Software-intensive systems are often independently developed, operated, managed, and evolved. Progressively, communication networks enabled these independent systems to interact, yielding a new kind of complex system, i.e. a system that is itself composed of systems, the so-called System-of-Systems (SoS). By its very nature, SoS is evolutionarily developed and exhibits emergent behavior. Actually, software architecture research has mainly focused on single systems, mostly large or very large distributed systems whose software architecture is described as design-time configurations of components linked together through connectors. However, it is well known that the restricted characteristics of single (even very large distributed) systems lead to architectural solutions (in terms of theories, languages, tools, and methods) that do not scale up to the case of systems-of-systems. Indeed, novel architectural solutions are needed to handle the complexity of software-intensive systems-of-systems in particular regarding the software architecture challenges implied by evolutionary development and emergent behavior. This paper presents the challenges facing software architecture research to address software-intensive systems-of-systems. It analyzes the discriminating characteristics of system-of-systems when compared with single systems from the software architecture perspective and focuses on recent advances in software architecture research to formally describe the architecture of software-intensive systems-of-systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",10.1007/978-3-319-48992-6_1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48992-6_1,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Super-network model of architecture for weapon equipment system of systems based on granular computing,"Architecture modeling using the super-network theory has been an important developing trend for description, evaluation and evolution analysis of system of systems. However, the proposed super-network models are still in the period of conception exploration. There are some limitations such as complex relation descriptions or co-influence mechanisms between the attributes and topology structures. The research situation of super-network modeling for architecture is summarized. Then, an approach about architecture modeling using the super-network based on granular computing is proposed. This method can integrate the topology structure with attri-butes using a granulation model descripted as a four tuples formalization. Moreover, it constructs the complex relations of the architecture for equipment system of systems using the super-network, based on which the relationship between the topology structure, activity, behavior and capability can be built synthetically. Finally, the granular model and the super-network model can be unified together with the super-edge. © 2016, Chinese Institute of Electronics.

2016,Design and integration of modular deep space habitat using a robust optimization framework,"The aim of this study is to provide a Systems of Systems framework that can guide the design and production of a multi-sourced, modular, deep space crew vehicle. This vehicle could be used to provide crew habitat for the exploration of cislunar space, near earth asteroids and Mars. The goal is to allow an entity, such as NASA, to leverage assets such as commercial and international partners by using near term or pre-existing hardware in a modular fashion. There exist today countless different pieces of space hardware, modules and vehicles that differ in their development level from preliminary designs to flight tested hardware. The ability to add or subtract modules at different points in a timeline could fall in line with the stepping stones approach NASA wishes to take. A portfolio optimization technique is used to explore combinations of pre-existing or near term hardware that work cohesively to meet overarching capability objectives. This approach also allows for the performance uncertainty of development stage hardware. Connectivity constraints of hardware are addressed through the use of network theory. This approach offers benefits such as robust design and the ability to spread a space budget across multiple sources of funding. The evolutionary capability of such an approach allows for early vehicle and hardware testing similar to the progression of the International Space Station. Disadvantages include the lack of complete control over portions of the every system and the added complexity in combining hardware. The aim of this study is to provide a useful metric when comparing to a single source monolithic space vehicle. Example scenarios explored at the end of this paper include the application of this method to exploration class missions including near Earth architectures, Mars architectures and an Earth-Mars cycler.

2015,"Incremental, distributed and concurrent scheduling in systems-of-systems with real-time requirements","Systems-of-Systems (SoS) are large-scale networked embedded systems that are characterized by operational and managerial independence of constituent systems, geographical distribution, emergent behavior and evolutionary development processes. This paper introduces a conceptual model and a scheduling algorithm for supporting real-time requirements in SoS. Real-time support is essential in many safety-relevant application areas such medical, military and industrial SoS. The search for a feasible schedule is computed incrementally upon the introduction of new applications in the SoS. The distributed computation of the schedule using the different constituent systems considers the lack of global knowledge and control in the SoS, while also reducing the overall scheduling time. Concurrent scheduling activities are supported to deal with the uncoordinated and possibly simultaneous introduction of multiple applications. The paper introduces a high-level scheduling algorithm for the SoS as well as a low-level scheduling problem for individual constituent systems. The incremental scheduling problem for the constituent systems is formulated using IBM CPLEX. An experimental evaluation with automatically generated examples demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed solution. © 2015 IEEE.",10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.284,,scopus; webofscience
2016,Future vertical lift airworthiness certification- should it be based on a civil aviation functional safety certification standard?,"As integration of software and hardware plays a bigger role in the design of complex systems and system of systems the terms Cyber Physical System (CPS) and Cyber Physical Vehicle System (CPVS) are used to describe this software enabled control (SEC) paradigm shift. A CPS is ?the next generation of system that requires tight integration of computing, communication, and control technologies to achieve stability, performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency in dealing with physical systems of many application domains?1. Pertaining to vehicle systems, a CPVS, ranging from automobile to aircraft and marine craft, is composed of tightly-coupled locomotion, computational and communication components. This SEC tight coupling has a major impact on the development and certification for future aircraft systems, such as Future Vehicle Lift (FVL). In the civil aircraft sector this tight SEC coupling is being addressed by new or substantially updated guidelines for civil aircraft and systems development, such as DO 297 and ARP 4754A. The tight interaction with ARP 4761 and dependence between certification and safety assessment at different levels, e.g. functional and item, are promoted through the use of supporting Development Assurance Levels (DALs). While in the military aircraft sector some attempts have been made to keep pace with this transition to CPVS tight coupling, the question is will this be adequate or relevant for FVL? Following an introduction, this paper will start with a review of functional safety certification standards and their evolution into the civil aircraft sector. This will be followed by a review of military aircraft airworthiness qualification standards. Finally, whether they are sufficient for future aircraft development, such as FVL, will be questioned. © 2016 by the American Helicopter Society International, Inc. All rights reserved.",,,scopus
2016,Applications of Big Data Analytics Tools for Data Management,"Data, at a very large scale, has been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for a long time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, social networks, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data”. Our interconnected world of today and the advent of cyber-physical or system of systems (SoS) are also a key source of data accumu-lation-be it numerical, image, text or texture, etc. SoS is basically defined as an integration of independently operating, non-homogeneous systems for certain duration to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Bayesian networks, data mining, pattern recognition, deep learning, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to (a) extract information, (b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, (c) optimize validation of clustered knowledge through evolutionary computing and eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”, and (d) Test and verify the model. This chapter attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. Four applications of big data analytics will be presented, i.e. solar, wind, financial and biological data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",10.1007/978-3-319-30265-2_8,,scopus; springerlink
2016,Ground segment infrastructure evolution necessitating development of next generation monitoring and control tool,"An ESA ground segment is a complex system-of-systems, consisting of hardware, software and networks, the continuous operation of which is critical for mission success. As these systems and the operations centre infrastructure evolve to meet newer and higher requirements, it is increasingly difficult to keep an overview, especially for long-term missions. In the case of XMM-Newton and Integral (ESA’s X-ray and γ-ray observatories) the complete Mission Control System (MCS) was recently upgraded from a client server system in place since the late 1990s. Physical servers and clients were replaced by virtual machines running on virtual hardware located in a remote data centre. The control rooms are now equipped with Desktop Terminal Units (DTU) connecting to a Sun-Ray Server (SRS) visualisation layer routing graphical displays from a remote server or client to the user’s screen through a Secure Global Desktop (SGD) connection. With this level of complexity it is challenging to keep an overview of each positions connections and exceedingly difficult to troubleshoot in case of problems. As budget for missions in extended lifetime are smaller than for new missions, reduced teams are required to supervise and operate these complex systems. Currently individual systems are used to monitor each ground segment facility. This breaks down the complexity, but requires more personnel and doesn’t allow an overall view. These facilities carry out system level monitoring but do not monitor the mission specific applications running on such systems. Furthermore some anomalies cannot be detected by monitoring each facility in isolation; their cause and effect extend across systems in different domains.. We present a new software, whose design is based on Integral and XMM-Newton’s use-case, but the philosophy and tool are configurable to suit the needs of any missions ground segment. Two major goals are to be achieved. A) to allow an easy overview of the complete end-to-end ground segment and the status, health and resource utilization of it’s services. B) to simplify and automate standard recovery actions. The first goal is to be achieved by allowing to dynamically scale the details from a high-level service view ideal e.g. for flight directors overseeing fleets of spacecraft, to mission-level overviews for Flight Control Teams, down to low-level hardware information for technical support teams. This way each team can concentrate on information relevant to their specific task or area and will only be warned or alarmed by issues directly affecting these tasks or areas. The second goal is to be achieved by automating ground segment recovery procedures such as system restarts or chain swaps and allowing the user to initiate them from the graphical overview. For example connecting an MCS server to a ground station can be done by simply dragging the link in the graphical overview. © 2016 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

We show that DEVS provides systems components and coupling for models of systems of systems with emergent behavior. Further. DEVS coupling supports dynamic structure for adaptive and evolution, and the Experimental Frame supports Emergence Behavior Observation. and a recent extension, DEVS Markov models, supports prediction of emergence derived from such observation.

2016,Big data analytic paradigms: From principle component analysis to deep learning,"Large sets of data (numerical, textural and image) have been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for a long time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, social networks, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data,” as part of thrust in robust intelligence. Big data is created in many ways in today’s highly inter-connected world. Social networks, system of systems (SoS: complex interoperable) systems and wireless systems are only some of the platforms creating big data. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Regression analysis, Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to (a) extract information, (b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and (c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”. This chapter attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. One of the recent most promising data analytic too is “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is the broad term for the recent development and extensions of neural networks in the machine learning community, which has allowed for state of the art results in speech, image, and natural language processing tasks. Hierarchical learning is an area of research which focuses on learning high order representations from low level data. Learning to recognize objects from images, recognizing words or syllables from audio, or recognizing poses and movement from video are all good examples of modern hierarchical learning research, which is a central focus of the “deep learning” movement in the machine learning and computational statistics community. This chapter will give a rather comprehensive look at all the BIG data analytic tools-old and new.

2016,Systems engineering beliefs: Contemplating personal perceptions regarding state of the art,"Systems engineering (SE) theories and practices for effectively dealing with complex systems are still evolving. Principal stakeholders are integral to complex systems, so we cannot predict or prespecify how the system changes. Every systems engineer has his own professional viewpoint derived from cultural background, upbringing/education and experience/maturation. The author has decided how all this fits his career and current 'mindsight'. He encourages other systems' engineers to examine and share their thoughts to help attain a more collective and forward looking view of systems engineering to advance the field. This paper provides a framework for system engineers to contemplate whether they are of the traditional system of systems; enterprise; or the complex type. Perspectives on SE attributes are offered to assist any systems engineer in characterizing his belief system, stylistic approach, and overall effectiveness in engineering complex systems. Systems engineers might reflect on what applies to them and to what relative extent. If a particular set of attributes dominates, is that appropriate? What changes in outlook, style, and emphasis might make a more effective systems engineer? Several existence categories are suggested and proportioned through each of life's stages. System engineers may contemplate how these trends have affected their past behaviors, and how possible re-directions might improve their future accomplishments. Thinking through what we have done, are doing, and want to do as systems' engineers is recommended. Anyone's chosen way is no better than any other possibility. It depends on a multitude of circumstances in each of our lives. © 2016 WIT Press.",10.2495/DNE-V11-N1-10-23,,scopus
2016,"Military knowledge management: Sense-making, decision making and knowledge creation","The paper studies the evolution of military Knowledge Management from a Command and Control perspective. The study is intended to support strategic planning of knowledge creating military organisation and defining the Enterprise Architecture for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information (C4I) System of systems (SoS). This paper is one part of writer's research in finding why so many C4I SoS implementations have faced challenges. Military Command and Control is studied within the framework of Knowledge Creation utilising tools of Evolution Theory and Path Creation to find patterns and dependencies. With this approach, the paper composes a roadmap for Military Knowledge Management. The study proceeds in finding further causalities and dependencies, which are useful in defining Military Enterprise Architectures. This approach identifies several ways to support the Cognitive level of Information Superiority defined by Perry, Signori and Boo (2004). The study proposes that development of a strategy following this approach should first begin with diagnoses of the three dimensions of Sense-making, Decision making and Learning utilising the defined roadmap before launching solution finding. The road map helps in recognising the current situation and assessing possibilities to improve them towards future. Flexibility becomes an essential requirement for all technical C4I systems since inflexibility in military structures may lead to strategic or operational surprise. The road map for Military Command and Control described in this paper is targeting to mitigate problems in defining the options and constraints for C4I architectures. It provides an additional method to analyse business layer of TOGAF 9.1 enterprise architecture model, especially from a military management viewpoint. The road map will help to align the development strategy with sense-making, decision making and organisational learning abilities.",,,scopus; webofscience
2015,Replacing capabilities within a system-of-systems: An architectural study on how to simplify the national airspace system,"The National Airspace System (NAS) is an enterprise system-of-systems designed to provide safe and efficient air travel in the United States. While the system is effective at accomplishing these tasks, the initial design for the NAS predated much of the formal systems engineering processes known today. This produced a complex system architecture that is not well suited to meet the needs of future system use and impedes implementing new requirements into the current system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently working on evolving the NAS into the Next Generation Air Traffic Control System (NextGen). With NextGen the FAA is applying classical systems engineering practices and can start to apply new practices from system-of-systems engineering (SoSE). Since SoSE is a growing discipline most of the early research has focused on identifying an unambiguous definition for a system-of-systems and developing new system-of-systems. However, one of the key challenges with NextGen is not to develop a new system-of-systems but instead to improve upon the system performance by redesigning and simplifying the current NAS architecture. This paper expands on current system-of-system development research in order to explore how to simplify an existing system-of-systems architecture by replacing the capabilities of the current system. The NAS in its entirety is too large and too complex of a system to fully analyze in this paper, and so the scope will be limited to the surveillance capability of the NAS. © 2015 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

2016,"The U.S. National Airspace System: A model for verification and validation of complex, distributed systems-of-systems","This paper presents an integrated verification and validation framework for large, complex, distributed systems-of-systems. The framework is driven by features of such systems that make traditional forms of verification and validation problematic: notably the large number of potential system states, network interactions leading to emergent behavior, flexible cohorts of constituent systems, dynamically evolving requirements, rapidly changing technology, and non-traditional acquisition models. The framework offered is based on integrated management of verification and validation throughout the life cycle; application of model based system engineering principles; use of agile development techniques; continuous monitoring during system operation; and the integration of embedded test tools and formal methods as part of the continuous monitoring process.

2015,The portfolio decision support tool (PDST): A software tool for architecture integration and visualization,"Portfolio Decision Support Tool (PDST) integrates and visualizes multi-faceted architectural data in support of the acquisition decision making process. The intent of the tool is to capture data in a structured process to facilitate architecture and enterprise-level analyses and to allow its users to focus on key factors by providing a dynamic interface to a broad underlying dataset. This paper describes the approach, layout, functionality, and applications of the tool and includes relevant examples that highlight its capabilities. Decision makers and systems analysts are challenged with the integration, management, and communication of large quantities of data and information relating to complex systems and system of systems. For space systems acquisition in particular, competing factors such as performance requirements, resilience, cost constraints, capability need dates, and acceptable risk profiles have to be juggled. This is further complicated by a large scope that usually encompasses legacy, transition, and future spacecraft programs along with its supporting ground segments and associated user segments. The long development cycles and large requirements sets add to the complexity of the enterprise as well. The goal of PDST is to ensure a broad, comprehensive, end-to-end perspective on an enterprise while maintaining the ability to drill down and access the supporting technical and program data, and it has been designed to simplify the process of capturing baselines, comparing alternatives, and archiving results. Some key features include the ability to show synchronization and interdependencies between portfolio elements, examine transition states and temporal evolution, and show context for each item. In addition to capturing the baseline architecture, PDST is also intended to compare potential future architecture alternatives. The comparison of competing technical and programmatic alternatives is enabled through definition and assessment against a full range of relevant metrics. The tool provides traceability by allowing the user to link the analysis and the supporting data to its pertaining system component. The decision process is helped by asking and providing answers to the “what if” questions associated with understanding potential solutions paths and uncertainties present in every acquisition. At the conclusion of a study, the tool archives the data and results in a repository, and the designs of both foundational “as-is” architectures and future alternatives can be reused in a future project. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

2016,Governance of interdependent infrastructure networks,"Introduction: Governance of infrastructure relates to the interactions and decision-making amongst multiple actors that result in the delivery, financing and payment for infrastructure services. Taking the system-of-systems approach adopted in this book, this chapter will approach the governance of infrastructure with a particular emphasis upon the challenges raised by interdependence between infrastructure sectors, building on the U.K. and international examples. This will inform a discussion of the governance implications of cross-sector strategies that have been explored in Chapter 10. Section 14.2 starts by discussing the key public and private stakeholders in the governance of infrastructure interdependencies and their interests. Section 14.3 discusses the emerging interest in the governance of infrastructure interdependencies, in joint infrastructure investment and coordination between sectors, and the stakeholders and processes through which these could be achieved. Section 14.4 discusses two case studies of infrastructure interdependencies (between electricity, ICT and private vehicles and between water and energy). It also reflects on the governance implications of the four cross-sector strategies discussed in Chapter 10. The aim is to consider how governance processes might need to change to address interdependencies between infrastructure sectors in the future. The chapter concludes with a summary in Section 14.5. Stakeholders in the governance of infrastructure interdependency During the twentieth century, the governance of most national infrastructure sectors has moved from a fragmented set of arrangements – with a mix of public and private provision – towards a national, market-led governance model. Principal features of this model are the introduction of competition into the infrastructure system to facilitate greater economic efficiency and reduce prices (Mitchell, 2008). Current U.K. infrastructures include (i) price regulated market driven infrastructures, such as ports and airports that are paid for by consumers; (ii) unregulated market driven consumer paid infrastructure, such as telecommunications and power plants; (iii) government funded infrastructure such as roads; and (iv) private-public finance initiatives delivered by Local Authorities, such as waste (CST, 2009). The evolution of institutions, rules, regulations and ownership arrangements has been accompanied by an increasingly diverse set of actors. The most prominent governance actors are national government departments, national economic regulators and national environmental regulators. The European Commission has played an increasingly important role, especially in environmental regulation and in pushing for more open markets and competition. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",10.1017/CBO9781107588745.015,,scopus
2015,"Advancing enquiry for system of systems engineering: Paradox, critical thinking, and critical systems enquiry","The complex nature of the system of systems engineering (SoSE) field and problems it addresses amplifies the need for effective enquiry. Enquiry serves to invoke higher level thinking that can better ground exploration of SoSE problems. Effective enquiry for SoSE practice is an essential first act in any SoSE endeavour and serves to frame all that follows. This paper explores three approaches to enquiry that can support more rigorous formulation of SoSE endeavours. First, paradox is introduced through a series of apparent contradictions for complex systems. The resolution' of these paradoxes invites thinking (enquiry) at a more systemic level, providing insights not achievable from more traditional modes of thinking. Second, we examine the field of critical thinking as a vehicle to invoke more rigorous thinking about complex issues in SoSE. Finally, critical systems enquiry is introduced through a set of eight critical questions to invoke deeper exploration for SoSE-based efforts. The invitation of these three different, but interrelated, enquiry streams provides a guide to elevate thinking for SoSE practitioners hoping to avoid thinking failures'. The paper concludes by suggesting challenges for practitioners, researchers, and the evolving SoSE field concerning development, incorporation, and prospects for more advanced systems-based enquiry.

2015,An Agent-Oriented Perspective on System of Systems for Multiple Domains,"Modeling and Simulation (M&S) plays a central role as a primary tool for representing a system of systems (SoS) and for the study of its evolution, behaviors, and performances. However, with respect to large-scale systems, SoSs present different and peculiar aspects that need to be accurately taken into account and are essential to address for the definition of effective approaches for M&S of SoSs.

Specifically, after the identification of the main issues for the M&S of SoSs, some of the main approaches for the M&S of SoSs are evaluated and compared in the chapter. Then, an agent-oriented perspective for SoS M&S, able to fully address the identified issues and overcoming the limitations of the currently available solutions, is proposed and exemplified by application examples in multiple domains. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",10.1002/9781118501757.ch8,,scopus; wiley
2016,Understanding human space exploration,"The number, size and complexity of systems currently envisioned for human space exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, present an unprecedented architecture design challenge. Explicit costs and risk constraints make the challenge even more daunting. Space agencies and private companies continue to propose new visions for realizing space exploration aspirations. Following changes in the approach to space exploration architecture design, this paper argues that the underlying mindset and analysis/synthesis approach must evolve anew as well. Single-threaded, bottom-up construction of alternatives will fall short in achieving the maximum results in terms of reliability, cost reduction, risk management, sustainability, and architecture resiliency when dealing with the complexity of the present challenge. This paper introduces a new paradigm well-suited to the challenge, one that allows both problem abstraction and solution via a System-of-Systems perspective. The System-of-Systems approach acknowledges the tension between technical and managerial independence and dependence together in a holistic view of space exploration. The paper demonstrates how to account for the known interactions between complex systems and the discovery of unknown ones, the partial independence of the systems involved, and the presence of multiple stakeholders with their economic and policy considerations. In this paper, we first decompose the challenges in space exploration architecture development into specific research questions. We then introduce the System-of-Systems approach, and describe how System-of-System traits and features of space exploration - such as independence of the systems, presence of multiple stakeholders, and interactions between systems - can be dealt with via an innovative approach. This methodology complements the traditional bottom-up approach of systems engineering with a top-down, holistic view, which allows designers and decision makers to understand and analyze the behavior of complex systems, and to evaluate different architectures, under varying working conditions. The user can compare architectures based on metrics of interest, perform trade-offs between competing desired features, and identify the most promising architectures and the causes of the observed behavior. We therefore present a call for action to improve the effectiveness of analysis and synthesis of space exploration systems, and describe various methodologies, tools and techniques needed that will add to the existing methods to achieve a more effective approach to space exploration systems design. The result is an increase in reliability, sustainability, and resiliency of evolving solution options, as well as an improvement in risk and cost management in space exploration.

2016,A knowledge-in-the-loop approach to integrated safety & security for cooperative system-of-systems,"A system-of-systems (SoS) is inherently open in configuration and evolutionary in lifecycle. For the next generation of cooperative cyber-physical system-of-systems, safety and security constitute two key issues of public concern that affect the deployment and acceptance. In engineering, the openness and evolutionary nature also entail radical paradigm shifts. This paper presents one novel approach to the development of qualified cyber-physical system-of-systems, with Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) as one target. The approach, referred to as knowledge-in-the-loop, aims to allow a synergy of well-managed lifecycles, formal quality assurance, and smart system features. One research goal is to enable an evolutionary development with continuous and traceable flows of system rationale from design-time to post-deployment time and back, supporting automated knowledge inference and enrichment. Another research goal is to develop a formal approach to risk-aware dynamic treatment of safety and security as a whole in the context of system-of-systems. Key base technologies include: (1) EAST-ADL for the consolidation of system-wide concerns and for the creation of an ontology for advanced run-time decisions, (2) Learning Based-Testing for run-time and post-deployment model inference, safety monitoring and testing, (3) Provable Isolation for run-time attack detection and enforcement of security in real-time operating systems. © 2015 IEEE.",10.1109/IntelCIS.2015.7397237,,scopus
2015,Evolution of the European concurrent design tool for space-based system-of-systems studies,"One major element in Concurrent Design is the central data model. It allows the various disciplines to share the latest information and to make immediate use of them within their domain specific tools and models. As a successor of the Integrated Design Model, in 2014 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the Open Concurrent Design Tool (OCDT), which aims to be the reference and standard model for European entities performing space system studies during early as well as later phases. This tool, including its web-based server and user interface supporting elements (such as MS Excel Add-ins), is developed in a way that it is not only limited to space system and mission design, but can be used also in other fields such as System-of-Systems (SoS) architecture definition and evaluation, which is becoming an emerging topic for European and international collaborations. Instead of just looking at the technical aspects of a system, SoS-studies provide an opportunity to analyze how to share resources and assets amongst institutions, organizations or nations more efficiently and how to provide integrated and more advanced services. However, due to the different nature and rules of SoS, the OCDT requires certain adaptations regarding domain specific tool interfaces, dedicated data libraries, as well as a SoS-specific data flow and representations to the users. Several studies were performed on ESA’s side in advance, to prepare an initial set of requirements for such an evolution of the tools and processes which eventually led to a project called “Development and Validation of a Generic Systems‐of‐Systems Concurrent Engineering Model (CESoS)”. It has been established by ESA and awarded to a consortium which has experience in Concurrent Design, software development and system architecture definitions. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

2015,"The integrated blast effects sensor suite: A rapidly developed, complex, system of systems","Spurned by the increasing concern and consciousness of traumatic brain injuries in deployed U.S. service members, the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force sought help from the Georgia Tech Research Institute to rapidly develop and deploy a system capable of gathering relevant soldier-centric data—the Integrated Blast Effects Sensor Suite. To meet aggressive program milestones and requirements, Georgia Tech Research Institute engaged in rapid systems engineering efforts focused on leveraging iterative development and test methodologies. Ultimately, an integrated system of systems composed of vehicle systems, soldier-worn headset and torso systems, and data retrieval systems was deployed to troops in Afghanistan for an operational assessment. The Integrated Blast Effects Sensor Suite development process and parallel efforts investigating injury dosimetry methodologies have yielded unique findings and lessons learned, which should be incorporated into future evolutions of similar systems. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.",10.7205/MILMED-D-14-00455,,scopus
2015,A system-of-systems approach to understanding urbanization – state of the art and prospect,"Purpose – City is an artificial dynamic open giant complex system, whose multifunctional and interdisciplinary characteristics leads to significant complexity. While challenges arising from individual urban functions have been the focus of urban studies, major urban challenges such as traffic congestion and inefficiency of resource usages may originate from the “interface” where different urban functions interact. Previous research has revealed the potential that regarding city as a system-of-systems (SoS) may shed light on solutions to various urban challenges. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – To examine this research potential, this paper begins with an overview of challenges in urbanization and current approaches which lack systematic solutions. The idea of applying SoS approach is then inspired by existing studies on urban metabolism where city is regarded as an entire system. This idea is followed by definition and characteristics of SoS, as well as comprehensive overview of the state of the art on SoS-based solutions to urban challenges. This paper then discusses the merits and limitations of current studies on SoS for urbanization, followed by a case study which precedes research visions. Findings – The paper finds that regarding city as SoS is a potentially effective approach for urban studies. This is highlighted by original research visions on how to advance this line of research. These research visions point out a few ideas for future research. It particularly highlights the role of human and information in the establishment, management and evolution of various urban functions. Originality/value – The originality of this paper lies in the use of the conception of “SoS” to emphasize the importance of properly modeling human and information in an urban system so as to better reveal the intra-SoS mechanism. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",10.1108/SASBE-07-2014-0038,,scopus
2016,The challenge of quantifying and modelling risk elements within collaborative infrastructures,"The rapid integration and dependence upon information and communication technologies (ICT) within varying industries, has augmented cyber interdependencies along with increasing other elements of risk such as complexity, cascading failure and single points of failure within collaborative infrastructures. Current solutions are inadequate, and incapable of adapting to the scale and complexity of these infrastructures. Furthermore, they are extremely rigid, focusing upon a specific risk, attack, vulnerability, and are industry specific. As a result, systems-of-systems (SoS) are failing directly owing to these significant risk elements. Our research demonstrates that while ICT has evolved quickly, solutions that attempt to identify issues and model large complex networks have failed to evolve at the same pace. In this paper we summarise the challenges and vulnerabilities which impact collaboration, and review significant risk elements which impede SoS, including existing solutions and methods which attempt to quantify risk. In addition, we outline our current and future work. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJRAM.2016.077376,,scopus

2016,Risk Assessment of Infrastructure System of Systems with Precursor Analysis,"Physical infrastructure systems are commonly composed of interconnected and interdependent subsystems, which in their essence constitute system of systems (S-o-S). System owners and policy researchers need tools to foresee potential emergent forced changes and to understand their impact so that effective risk management strategies can be developed. We develop a systemic framework for precursor analysis to support the design of an effective and efficient precursor monitoring and decision support system with the ability to (i) identify and prioritize indicators of evolving risks of system failure; and (ii) evaluate uncertainties in precursor analysis to support informed and rational decision making. This integrated precursor analysis framework is comprised of three processes: precursor identification, prioritization, and evaluation. We use an example of a highway bridge S-o-S to demonstrate the theories and methodologies of the framework. Bridge maintenance processes involve many interconnected and interdependent functional subsystems and decision-making entities and bridge failure can have broad social and economic consequences. The precursor analysis framework, which constitutes an essential part of risk analysis, examines the impact of various bridge inspection and maintenance scenarios. It enables policy researchers and analysts who are seeking a risk perspective on bridge infrastructure in a policy setting to develop more risk informed policies and create guidelines to efficiently allocate limited risk management resources and mitigate severe consequences resulting from bridge failures. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis",10.1111/risa.12559,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2015,A Complex Adaptive System of Systems Approach to Human-Automation Interaction in Smart Grid,"This chapter expresses three cognitive genres: descriptive genre, normative/prescriptive genre, and know-how genre. The descriptive genre introduces and discusses on the following disciplines: the core concepts of complexity, complex adaptive system (CAS) of systems (CASoS), the application domains of human-automation interaction (HAI) and adaptive autonomy (AA), especially in Smart Grid, and two implementation ideas of expert systems and Petri nets. The chapter describes the automation related notions, that is, automation and HAI, followed by the investigation of HAI models' evolution from the perspectives of dimensions and dynamism. The idea of AA is then introduced as a dynamic HAI scheme, followed by the classification of AA implementation methods. Petri nets are introduced as powerful tools for modeling complex systems (CxS). Finally, Petri net realization of the adaptive autonomy expert system (AAES) is presented, followed by a performance evaluation study. © 2015 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

2015,Sensor resource management to support UAS integration into the national airspace system,"The National Air Space (NAS) is often described as a complex aviation system-of-systems that seamlessly works in harmony to provide safe transit for all aircraft within its domain. The number of aircraft within the NAS is growing and according the FAA1, “[o]n any given day, more than 85,000 flights are in the skies in the United States…this translates into roughly 5,000 planes in the skies above the United States at any given moment. More than 15,000 federal air traffic controllers in airport traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities and air route traffic control centers guide pilots through the system"". The expected increase in projected density of aircraft, including integration of UAVs, requires innovative resource allocation methodologies to task and re-task sensors (radar systems) to effectively monitor airborne vehicles and ensure aircraft adhere to the minimum separation requirement. Our approach is to use an evolutionary algorithm to evolve the task assignment. In addition, we utilize the Kalman Filter’s covariance matrices to determine positional uncertainty in our estimates to predict if a separation requirement is violated. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

2015,Competencies for governance of complex systems of systems,"Systems of Systems (SoS) require organisational components to have staff with abilities appropriate to the challenges within SoS. Large organisations frequently use competency models as a tool to ensure that their staff have the proper skills to deal with these challenges. Competency models have been used for 40 years to select, train, promote or separate employees. While competency models represent an improvement on their primary predecessor, intelligence tests, weaknesses have been noted in the literature and challenges have been made to improve them. Most improvement efforts have been evolutionary adjustments or insertion of more elements. This research presents a completely new way to create, assess or transform a competency model. This framework can be used to design, assess or transform an existing competency model.

2014,Network oriented cyber security model (NOCS-M),"Cyber vulnerabilities and weaponry present growing threats to complex networked systems and networkcentric operations. Several approaches have been employed to study and understand cyber effects. A prevailing method utilizes cyber test ranges consisting of physical computers and virtual machines on which actual malware is exercised on quarantined networks. Such test-ranges provide crucial information about the details of malware mechanisms, but are expensive to operate and scale upward while offering limited availability. We describe a distinct but complementary approach for scaling cyber effects to the systems-of-systems network level through simulation. Detailed data obtained from cyber test-ranges are leveraged in software models containing only the abstractions needed for determining system level effects. The Network Oriented Cyber Security Model (NOCS-M) offers lower costs, greater safety, and the ability to integrate within existing federations to provide cyber-realism. The capability leverages cyber-ranges, and promotes the study of cyber impacts on mission level operations, as well as rapid evolution of more secure systems. The initial implementation of NOCS-M, explored basic classes of abstractions needed for capturing cyber effects. It demonstrates faster than real-time operation, high-fidelity, low-cost, and ability to scale to arbitrary networks rapidly. New and hypothesized threats may be quickly modeled in this approach. This paper describes the malware threat taxonomy and cyber network model architecture. Copyright © (2014) by SISO - Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization All rights reserved.",,,scopus

Our model also utilizes concepts from Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE) research discipline and uses agent-based modelling as the main modeling technique which should allow capturing any potential emergent and evolutionary behaviors. Upon its completion, the model should provide policy makers with comprehensive decision-support processes, tools, and techniques that allow the ex-ante analysis of the potential outcomes of public construction investment on the economy.",,,scopus
2015,Interoperability as a key concept for the control and evolution of the system of systems (Sos),"A coalition of enterprises wanting to collaborate, and more generally a Collaborative Network of Organizations (CNO), can conceptually be assimilated as a System of Systems (SoS) presenting a number of characteristics to respect all over its life cycle. Interoperability is one of these characteristics (both functional and non-functional), which is from our point of view, essential in order to guarantee the control of the SoS, its behavior and the fulfillment of its mission(s). Moreover, it ensures the reaction of the SoS to deal with some risky situations and with potential local or global deficits during its functioning. In this paper, we propose to determine the relation between the current level of interoperability of the SoS and its functioning whatever may be its situation. A matrix shows how this relation evolves taking into account several characteristics of the SoS, particularly its capacity to respect interoperability requirements (Compatibility, Interoperation, Autonomy and Reversibility) and the so-called analysis perspectives of the SoS: Performance, Integrity and Stability. This relation is requested in order to permit and to guide SoS behavioral simulation currently in development.

The EU Waste Management Strategy's requirements emphasizes waste prevention; recycling and reuse; and improving final disposal and monitoring. Integrated waste management systems can be defined as the selection and application of suitable and available techniques, technologies and management programs to achieve waste management objectives and goals. As a result of the complexity and uncertainty occurring in sustainable waste management systems, the fuzzy cognitive map method is used with the combination of the bacterial evolutionary algorithm to support the planning and decision making process of integrated systems. Since the fuzzy cognitive map method is formed for a selected system by determining the concepts and their relationships, it is possible to quantitatively simulate the system considering its parameters. Several techniques were used in order to produce the input data of the simulation process. The goal of this paper is to present the process of data production. © Civil-Comp Press, 2014.",,,scopus

2014,Architectural support for model-driven performance prediction of distributed real-time embedded systems of systems,"Systems of systems (SoS) are large-scale systems composed of complex systems with difficult to predict emergent properties. One of the most significant challenges in the engineering of such systems is how to predict their non-functional properties such as performance, and more specifically, how to model non-functional properties when the overall system functionality is not available. In this paper, we define an approach to SoS performance prediction based on the modelling of system interactions and their impacts. We adopt an Event Driven Architecture to support this modelling, as it allows for more realistic and flexible performance simulation, which enables more accurate performance prediction. We introduce a generic architecture and present its instantiation in a software architecture for the performance prediction of defence SoS. Our architecture allows for loose coupling, interoperability, and adaptability and facilitates sustainable evolution of the performance model of the SoS. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",10.1007/978-3-319-09970-5_30,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

One of the initiatives consists of taking care of the wounded persons as soon as possible, respecting the ""golden hour"" rule. This rule prescribes that the earlier the wounded persons are taken care of, the less grave the after effects will be. In order to reach this goal, emergency services must be informed as soon as possible after the accident occurs. This chapter presents the stakes of the golden hour and the fast intervention of the emergency services. It then analyzes the system of the systems engineering process implemented to reach at the goal. The main keys for engineering the life-critical system of systems are also provided.

2014,"System of systems design verification: problematic, trends and opportunities","System of Systems (SoS) Engineering (SoSE) requires to be able to model and to argue the quality of the modeled solution, thanks to various objectives prior to any other efforts. This paper presents and discusses the development of an approach to support SoSE activities and particularly to achieve SoS modeling and verification. First, requested models are identified and illustrated here on Virtual Enterprise domain (VE). Second, it is proposed to merge two complementary verification approaches, formal proof and simulation. This allows us to ensure particularly the stability, integrity and control expectations of the proposed SoS solution, and must encompass particularly three main SoS characteristics chosen here that can impact SoS stability, integraty and controllability. These characteristics are connectivity, particularly subsystems’ interoperability abilities, evolution and emergence of behaviors and properties which are due to the subsystems’ interactions when fulfilling the SoS operational mission. For this, a formal properties specification and proof approach allow the verification of the adequacy and coherence of SoS models with regard to these characteristic and to stakeholders’ requirements. Then, simulation based on Multi Agents Systems (MAS) allows the execution of the architectural model of SoS. This allows to detect potential emergent operational scenarios and then to obtain an approached behavioral model of the SoS. This MAS is enriched by concepts and mechanisms allowing to evaluate some criteria to facilitate and guide the identification of such operational scenarios. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",10.1007/978-3-319-04948-9_34,,scopus; springerlink

System of systems and system of systems engineering have presented themselves as key approaches to address problems related to complex, dynamic systems and how best to manage them effectively and efficiently. Healthcare systems are complex and currently facing several challenges.

Systems in this context are independently designed and can operate autonomously following both global SoS goals and individual goals. A major aspect of SoSs is the evolution over time, i.e. the change of its architecture as a result of changes in the context of the SoS or the changes of individual or global goals. The aim of this paper is to define a modeling concept for evolution specifying all possible changes of the SoS over time. This evolution model is used to generate and analyze future architectures enabling the prediction of future violations of static specifications.

2013,Examining potentials of building M&A preparedness,"Enterprises are systems of systems that continuously evolve during their lifespan, be it in a directed or emergent way. As enterprises are in fact socio-technical systems, this evolution may occur in one or more specific areas - such as the human / organizational, the technology and / or the Information System that integrates the activities performed by humans and machines (technology). This paper addresses a special type of change, brought about by enterprise mergers or acquisitions (M&As). M&As are an important strategic transformation instrument in the hands of management; however, literature reveals that an alarming high percentage of M&As do not achieve their declared objectives. In this paper we attempt to a) demonstrate that the success of such strategic changes depends on several essential and largely overlooked factors, and b) outline a possible approach of building preparedness for M&As), so as to improve the chances of success. This paper also presents a retrospective M&A case analysis to demonstrate the types of potential problems that could have been effectively addressed by anticipatory transformation facilitated by the proposed preparedness building approach.",10.5220/0004418201990210,,scopus; webofscience
2014,Military system of systems architecting with individual system contracts,"This paper studies the process of architecting a System of Systems (SoS) where the SoS architect can negotiate with individual systems. Particularly, the SoS architect aims to select a set of systems to provide a set of capabilities required for the SoS as well as the interfaces that enable communications amongst the selected systems. The SoS architect regards a set of three objectives: cost and deadline minimization and performance maximization. The performance levels of the capabilities provided by a system can be improved through additional funds contracted by the SoS architect. The system decides on how to use the allocated funds. We model the resulting Stackelberg game between the SoS architect and the individual systems as a multi-objective multi-level optimization problem. Three evolutionary heuristic methods are proposed and compared in a set of numerical studies. Further numerical studies illustrate the benefits of the modeling approach compared to system contracting after system selection. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s11590-014-0821-z,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11590-014-0821-z,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,Transitioning the SWFTS program combat system product family from traditional document-centric to model-based systems engineering,"Over the past four years, the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) program has shifted from traditional document-centric systems engineering to a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) process for managing the evolution and support of the common combat system used by most submarines in the U.S. and Royal Australian Navies. At the beginning of this transition a pilot study established technical feasibility, and projected a 13% reduction in the cost of processing a baseline if MBSE were applied to support the SWFTS system of systems baseline development process. Over the course of two years of development new modeling techniques were invented, and a large-scale system of systems model was designed, implemented, and populated. Now the transition to operations has begun. In early 2012 SWFTS SE&I produced its first new generation of combat system interface baselines using MBSE. The technical foundation has been established, and the workforce transition is under way. Anticipated cost reductions are still a year away as the workforce ascends the learning curve, but the program is already seeing improvements in the quality and consistency of engineering products.

2014,Evolving software systems,"During the last few years, software evolution research has explored new domains such as the study of socio-technical aspects and collaboration between different individuals contributing to a software system, theuse of search-based techniques and meta-heuristics, the mining of unstructured software repositories, the evolution of software requirements, and the dynamic adaptation of software systems at runtime. Also more and more attention is being paid to the evolution of collections of inter-related and inter-dependent software projects, be it in the form of web systems, software product families, software ecosystems or systems of systems. Withthis book, the editors present insightful contributions on these and other domains currently being intensively explored, written by renowned researchers in the respective fields of software evolution. Each chapter presents the state of the art in a particular topic, as well as the current research, available tool support and remaining challenges. The book is complemented by a glossary of important terms used in the community, a reference list of nearly 1,000 papers and books and tips on additional resources that may be useful to the reader(reference books, journals, standards and major scientific events in the domain of software evolution and datasets). This book is intended for all those interested in software engineering, and more particularly, software maintenance and evolution. Researchers and software practitioners alike will find in the contributed chapters an overview of the most recent findings, covering a broad spectrum of software evolution topics. In addition, it can also serve as the basis of graduate or postgraduate courses on e.g., software evolution, requirements engineering, model-driven software development or social informatics. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",10.1007/978-3-642-45398-4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-45398-4.pdf,scopus; googlescholar

2014,Architectural key dimensions for a successful electronic health record implementation,"The availability of patient clinical data can be vital to a more effective diagnosis and treatment, by an healthcare professional. This information should be accessible regardless of context, place, time or where it was collected. In order to share this type of data, many countries have initiated projects aiming to implement Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Throughout the years, some were more successful than others but all of them were complex and difficult to materialise. The research involves the study of four international projects - in Canada, Denmark, England and France - launched with the goal of fostering the clinical data sharing in the respective countries, namely by implementing EHR-like systems. Those case studies served as data to identify the critical issues in this area. To address the challenge of sharing clinical information, the authors believe to be necessary to act in three different dimensions of the problem: (1) the engagement of the stakeholders and the alignment of the system development with the business goals (2) the building of complex systems of systems with the capability to evolve and easily admit new peers (3) the interoperability between different systems which use different conventions and standards.",10.5220/0004867301360143,,scopus
2014,System of systems logistics network design and inventory control using evolutionary algorithms,"Logistical inefficiencies and excessive resource demands are some of the issues caused by bad planning of Forward Operating Bases. Forward Operating Bases (FOB's) are temporary military contingency base camps established to support and facilitate tactical operations on foreign soil. The logistics model considers the relationships between various base camp components and optimizes the distance to be traveled by the on camp logistic vehicle for all the utilities (fuel, potable water, waste, etc.). Evolutionary Algorithms takes into account of all the base camp constraints and will be used to optimally distribute the resources required for the overall base. Changes in the subsystem constraints are appropriately added and solved simultaneously when a change is made to the base camp design. The model can satisfy all the base camp needs while keeping the overall system lean. The flexible logistics model facilitates the use of dynamic design processes in order to integrate with external simulation tools, making it possible to communicate with other system of system tools.",,,scopus
2015,Expert-Based Method of Integrated Waste Management Systems for Developing Fuzzy Cognitive Map,"Movement towards more sustainable waste management practice has been identified as a priority in the whole of EU. The EU Waste Management Strategy's requirements emphasize waste prevention; recycling and reuse; and improving final disposal and monitoring. In addition, in Hungary the national waste strategy requires an increase in the household waste recycling and recovery rates. Integrated waste management system (IWMS) can be defined as the selection and application of suitable and available techniques, technologies and management programs to achieve waste management objectives and goals. In this paper, the concept of ‘key drivers’ are defined as factors that change the status quo of an existing waste management system in either positive or negative direction. Due to the complexity and uncertainty occurring in sustainable waste management systems, we propose the use of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and bacterial evolutionary algorithm (BEA) methods to support the planning and decision making process of integrated systems, as the combination of the FCM and BEA seem to be suitable to model complex mechanisms such as IWMS. Since the FCM is formed for a selected system by determining the concepts and their relationships, it is possible to quantitatively simulate the system considering its parameters. The goal of optimization was to find such a connection matrix for FCM that makes possible to generate the most similar time series. This way a more objective description of IWMS can be given. While the FCM model represents the IWMS as a whole, BEA is used for parameter optimization and identification. Based on the results, in the near future we intend to apply the systems of systems (SoS) approach to regional IWMS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",10.1007/978-3-319-12883-2_4,,scopus; springerlink
2014,Communication and capability URLs in COAST-based decentralized services,"Decentralized systems are systems-of-systems whose services are governed by two or more separate organizations under distinct spheres of authority. Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary. Client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST) relies on capability security to minimize the risks of client-driven customization, for which fine-grain management of communication capability is critical. We introduce the Capability URL (CURL) as the unit of communication capability and show how two distinct mechanisms, communication capability and mobile code, can be combined to express and enforce constraints on the communications among decentralized computations. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

2014,The role of parts in the system behaviour,"In today’s world, we are surrounded by software-based systems that control so many critical activities. Every few years we experiment dramatic software failures and this asks for software that gives evidence of resilience and continuity. Moreover, we are observing an unavoidable shift from stand-alone systems to systems of systems, to ecosystems, to cyber-physical systems and in general to systems that are composed of various independent parts that collaborate and cooperate to realise the desired goal.; Our thesis is that the resilience of such systems should be constructed compositionally and incrementally out of the resilience of system parts. Understanding the role of parts in the system behaviour will (i) promote a “divide-and-conquer strategy” on the verification of systems, (ii) enable the verification of systems that continuously evolve during their life-time, (iii) allow the detection and isolation of faults, and (iv) facilitate the definition of suitable reaction strategies. In this paper we propose a methodology that integrates needs of flexibility and agility with needs of resilience. We instantiate the methodology in the domain of a swarm of autonomous quadrotors that cooperate in order to achieve a given goal. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",10.1007/978-3-319-12241-0_3,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2014,Many-objective optimization and decision-making for portfolio planning of armament system of systems,"In order to attack the many-objective problem in armament system of systems (ASoS) portfolio planning (the numbers of objectives ≥ 5), an integrated optimization and decision-making approach with three-stage is proposed. This approach first applies goal programming technique to convert this problem formulations with large-dimensional objectives into a normal multi-objective optimization model (the numbers of objectives ≤ 3), a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm then is developed to solve the converted model and obtain the Pareto set, a forecasting and optimization based ideal solution algorithm finally is proposed to obtain the best fit compromised solution from the Pareto set. A case of portfolio planning for reconnaissance ASoS illustrates the effectiveness of each module and the integral of the proposed approach. This approach can provide the decision-making support for armaments development and top-level planning. ©, 2014, Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved.",,,scopus
2014,Big data analytic paradigms-from PCA to deep learning,"Large sets of data (numerical, textural and image) have been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for a long time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, social networks, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of ""Big Data"". Big data is created in many ways in today's highly inter-connected world. Social networks, system of systems (SoS: complex interoperable) systems and wireless systems are only some of the platforms creating big data. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called ""Data Analytics"", which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of ""Big Data"" to a manageable size and apply these tools to a) extract information, b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the ""Big Data"". This paper attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytic to develop reliable models for such systems. One of the recent most promising data analytic too is ""Deep Learning"". Deep learning is the broad term for the recent development and extensions of neural networks in the machine learning community, which has allowed for state of the art results in speech, image, and natural language processing tasks. Hierarchical learning is an area of research which focuses on learning high order representations from low level data. Learning to recognize objects from images, recognizing words or syllables from audio, or recognizing poses and movement from video are all good examples of modern hierarchical learning research, which is a central focus of the ''deep learning"" movement in the machine learning and computational statistics community. This paper will give a rather comprehensive look at all the BIG data analytic tools - old and new. Data bases of photovoltaic and wind energy data will all be used here.",,,scopus
2014,Twenty-five years of formal methods and railways: What next?,"Since more than 25 years, railway signalling is the subject of successful industrial application of formal methods in the development and verification of its computerized equipment. However the evolution of the technology of railways signalling systems in this long term has had a strong influence on the way formal methods can be applied in their design and implementation. At the same time important advances had been also achieved in the formal methods area. The scope of the formal methods discipline has enlarged from the methodological provably correct software construction of the beginnings to the analysis and modelling of increasingly complex systems, always on the edge of the ever improving capacity of the analysis tools, thanks to the technological advances in formal verification of both qualitative and quantitative properties of such complex systems. The thesis we will put forward in this paper is that the complexity of future railway systems of systems can be addressed with advantage only by a higher degree of distribution of functions on local interoperable computers - communicating by means of standard protocols - and by adopting a multi-level formal modelling suitable to support the verification at different abstraction levels, and at different life-cycle times, of the safe interaction among the distributed functions. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",10.1007/978-3-319-05032-4_13,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2014,System of systems future capability requirement of tourism industry: Towards intelligence approach based evaluation,"With the strengthening of the position and role of tourism industry in the national economy, its industrial organization composition and its interaction with other socio-economic sectors become increasingly complex, therefore forms more complex stakeholder networks and interest balance problems, and brings more profound impacts on regional economy, social culture, ecology and environment. The complexity of tourism industry has been gradually recognized in practice. However, the unique features demonstrated in tourism development, such as vagueness of industrial boundary and problem that optimization of group or individual interests does not guarantee industrial overall optimization, have revealed some limitations of complexity science world of view and brought about certain difficulties in the application of complex systems approaches. In other words, tourism research is facing an emerging ""system of systems"" problem, which hinders the comprehensive capability and the joint capability of tourism industry. Therefore, this paper explores system of systems (SoS) science as an alternative paradigm to simulate the structure and the evolution of large-scale complex tourism industrial organizations, and puts forward a concept set of ""System of Systems Future Capability Requirement (SoSFCR)"" to assess the strategic capability desired in the future evolution stages of tourism industry. A frame of system of systems engineering process based on intelligence approaches is proposed as well. Though still in initial stage, the future capability oriented system of systems thinking exhibits great potential for industrial planning and management. © 2014 by CESER PUBLICATIONS.",,,scopus

It is interesting to note that although some of these SoSs characteristics are intrinsic in nature of the SCs others such as evolutionary behaviour and self-organization need to be modelled. In this paper, an adaptive supply chain multi-level multi-objective optimisation framework has been proposed in order to have both evolutionary and self-organized behaviour.

2014,An integrated modeling framework for exploring flow regime and water quality changes with increasing biofuel crop production in the U.S. Corn Belt,"To better address the dynamic interactions between human and hydrologic systems, we develop an integrated modeling framework that employs a System of Systems optimization model to emulate human development decisions which are then incorporated into a watershed model to estimate the resulting hydrologic impacts. The two models are run interactively to simulate the coevolution of coupled human-nature systems, such that reciprocal feedbacks between hydrologic processes and human decisions (i.e.; human impacts on critical low flows and hydrologic impacts on human decisions on land and water use) can be assessed. The framework is applied to a Midwestern U.S. agricultural watershed, in the context of proposed biofuels development. This operation is illustrated by projecting three possible future coevolution trajectories, two of which use dedicated biofuel crops to reduce annual watershed nitrate export while meeting ethanol production targets. Imposition of a primary external driver (biofuel mandate) combined with different secondary drivers (water quality targets) results in highly nonlinear and multiscale responses of both the human and hydrologic systems, including multiple tradeoffs, impacting the future coevolution of the system in complex, heterogeneous ways. The strength of the hydrologic response is sensitive to the magnitude of the secondary driver; 45% nitrate reduction target leads to noticeable impacts at the outlet, while a 30% reduction leads to noticeable impacts that are mainly local. The local responses are conditioned by previous human-hydrologic modifications and their spatial relationship to the new biofuel development, highlighting the importance of past coevolutionary history in predicting future trajectories of change. © 2014.

2014,Evolving robust networks for systems-of-systems: Is it viable for large networks?,"Software systems that rely on ad-hoc networks are increasingly complex and prevalent. Some of these systems provide vital functionality to emergency services, military operations, and disaster relief; such systems may have significant impact on the safety of people involved in those operations. It is therefore important that those networks support critical software requirements, including those for latency of packet transfer. If a network ceases to meet the software's requirements (e.g. due to a link failure) then engineers must be able to understand it well enough to reconfigure the network and restore it to a requirement-satisfying state. Given a complex network, it is difficult for a human to do this, especially under time pressure. Tool support would therefore be valuable. This paper presents a search-based tool which takes as input a network defined using the Network Description Language (NDL), annotated with a set of network-hosted applications and a set of latency requirements between each. The tool can evolve variants of the network configuration which meet the requirements and are robust to single link failures, using multi-objective optimisation to resolve the conflicting demands of robustness and low resource use. We have investigated how the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be configured to find good results, and how the time taken to evolve networks scales with the size of the network. We conclude that the approach is effective for small networks (tens of nodes) but scales poorly beyond that. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",10.1007/s10664-013-9295-3,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

It is explained that by so distributing the design authority, under certain circumstances the ""apparent complexity"" of the system visible to any one designer can be reduced. To ensure the success of organised self-design, the approach uses their extension of Suh's axiomatic design theory with the ""axiom of recursion.""

2012,Challenges in complex systems science,"FuturICT foundations are social science, complex systems science, and ICT. The main concerns and challenges in the science of complex systems in the context of FuturICT are laid out in this paper with special emphasis on the Complex Systems route to Social Sciences. This include complex systems having: many heterogeneous interacting parts; multiple scales; complicated transition laws; unexpected or unpredicted emergence; sensitive dependence on initial conditions; path-dependent dynamics; networked hierarchical connectivities; interaction of autonomous agents; self-organisation; non-equilibrium dynamics; combinatorial explosion; adaptivity to changing environments; co-evolving subsystems; ill-defined boundaries; and multilevel dynamics. In this context, science is seen as the process of abstracting the dynamics of systems from data. This presents many challenges including: data gathering by large-scale experiment, participatory sensing and social computation, managing huge distributed dynamic and heterogeneous databases; moving from data to dynamical models, going beyond correlations to cause-effect relationships, understanding the relationship between simple and comprehensive models with appropriate choices of variables, ensemble modeling and data assimilation, modeling systems of systems of systems with many levels between micro and macro; and formulating new approaches to prediction, forecasting, and risk, especially in systems that can reflect on and change their behaviour in response to predictions, and systems whose apparently predictable behaviour is disrupted by apparently unpredictable rare or extreme events.

2012,Design method requirements for agile system of systems,"The paper defines the need for new and innovative methods for business analysts to analyze and design systems in the emerging agile environments. The paper goal is to provide models for business analysts to identify collaborative arrangements needed to sustain collaboration within continually evolving business environment. The paper begins by describing the characteristics of the emerging environments and the requirements of new design methodologies. It focuses on ways to manage complexity, process integration and emphasis on social structures needed to respond creatively to changes in the environment. The goal is to create an architecture that encourages the emergence of new collaborations in response to changes in the environment and can easily accommodate process change. The collaborative architecture defines the collaborative arrangements and responsibilities to make the collaboration sustainable. The paper develops a framework to describe business networks as a system of systems and ways to model collaboration between the different systems. The paper then proposes living systems theory as the framework for identifying the relationships of business units of different organizations and the messaging structure to support emerging collaboration between the business units. The paper illustrates a way to model a system of systems using living systems theory. It combines this theory with open modelling to show ways to manage complexity, process integration and collaboration. It then describes the kinds of tools needed to support the modelling and illustrates with an example of its use. It uses process outsourcing that involves a number of partners and suppliers as an example. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.",,,scopus; webofscience
2012,Prioritizing tests for fault localization,"Maritime Safety and Security Systems of Systems (MSS SoS) evolve dynamically during operation, i.e., at runtime. After each runtime evolution, the quality assurance of the integrated system of systems has to be verified again. It is therefore necessary to devise an appropriate verification strategy that not only achieves this goal, but also minimizes the cost, e.g., time, resources, disruption, of checking after each modification. During testing, test prioritization techniques heuristically select test cases to minimize the time to detect the presence of a fault. However, this obviates that once a fault has been detected, it must be localized and isolated/repaired. Test suites prioritized for fault detection can reduce the amount of useful information for fault localization, increasing the cost of fault localization, e.g., with respect to randomly chosen tests. In this chapter we introduce fault localization prioritization and two new test case prioritization heuristics that greatly reduce the cost of fault localization (up to 80%) with almost no increase on the fault detection cost. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

2012,Enterprise systems engineering-practical challenges and emerging solutions,"Much attention has been given over the last 10-20 years to the development of mature practices for engineering complex systems, and these are now largely in place in many large organisations and companies, underpinned by professional bodies such as INCOSE and an increasing number of university departments. Moving the practice of systems engineering into wider fields remains problematic, with many false starts-and even backward steps. While much has been written about Enterprise Systems Engineering-and the allied subject of Systems of Systems-making the transition from theory to practice has proved tortuous and complex, requiring attention to re-engineering the organisation as well as the projects it undertakes. This paper draws on the authors' combined experience-gained from working across a range of organisations, both inside and outside defence-and discusses emerging strategies for coping with the challenges of joined-up projects and programmes.

2013,Describing Systems of Systems: A preliminary comparison of the literature to current state practices,"Many organizations, particularly government agencies, are evolving new operational capabilities via a System of Systems (SoS) approach. Although a broad body of SoS knowledge exists, where SoS definitions, classification and characterization are deeply discussed, there are limited studies that empirically confirm these conceptualizations of SoS from the literature. The paper presents a preliminary qualitative study of the classification and characterization of the technical, i.e., development, dimension of nine government-related SoS programs. SoS characteristics are grouped into two categories: SoS Developer Organization and inter-office characteristics. Through semi-structured interviews, and the subsequent coding analysis, we found noticeable differences between the literature and practice, in particular, the apparent difficulty of classifying SoS according to the classification types from the SoS literature and the critical role of the SoS Program Office. To advance the SoS research stream, future research should include more empirical studies of the impact of SoS characteristics on the ability of the SoS to develop and deliver a capability.",,,scopus
2013,A lean approach to improving SE visibility in large operational systems evolution,"It is often difficult to understand the status of capability development in large operational systems. Schedules are rarely stable. This is due to factors such as: the size and complexity of capabilities; unexpected changes in priorities; depth of supplier chains; variety and availability of special engineering resources; contract structure; and the inherently complex nature of such operations. Lean approaches use the concepts of work in progress (WIP) and capacity to maximize flow through a process.

2012,Searching air sectors for risk: ASHiCS (automating the search for hazards in complex systems),"ASHiCS permits the automatic discovery of high risk air traffic scenarios. In this paper we describe the evolutionary search used in ASHiCS and present an analysis of the project's Stage 2 solution landscape. We suggest that random or exhaustive search is infeasible given the size of the solution space presented by simple air traffic scenarios, and that standard linear regression modeling is unlikely to find traffic input patterns that indicate the presence of high risk. While ASHiCS successfully targets high risk scenarios, we remain faced with very large search spaces in future Systems of Systems (SoS) models, and hope that our investigations into linear regression modeling will lead to a generic technique of practical value in the dimension reduction of these large search spaces.",,,scopus

Deep Blue Tech has started the development of the capability and capacity required to take on this challenge. It involves building the team, the processes, the plans and the tools constituting the core of an enduring submarine development enterprise, which underpins a level of sovereign independence for Australia's future submarine capability. Deep Blue Tech (a wholly owned subsidiary of ASC) has since its inception in 2007 developed the capability to create conceptual submarine solutions from high level needs, applying a life-cycle perspective and system engineering principles. It is an integration challenge activity requiring broad domain knowledge across the subsystems while taking into account the many interdisciplinary speciality engineering domains. A significant part of the challenge is the fact that the submarine, including its crew, is a complex system of systems. The approach, while requirement driven, is fundamentally evolutionary and iterative making use of best practice and lessons learned in all phases of the life cycle of previous submarines. It is based on the unique Australian circumstances including the fact that development has to start from the current state.

2013,Concurrent system engineering in air traffic management: Steering the SESAR program,"As a ""System of Systems"" (SoS), Air Traffic Management (ATM) in Europe will be improved by simultaneous and coordinated evolutions of its constituting systems. The SESAR Program aims at reaching an ambitious performance target (for 2020) by developing a large collection of ""Operational Improvement Steps"" (OIs). This development is achieved by more than 300 projects, themselves involving a number of partners working at their own site throughout Europe. To face this challenge, the SJU supported by EADS through an ""industrial support"" contract, has organized the management of the contributing projects on some basic principles: - The SESAR Program is Performance-driven: this principle gives priority to developments that demonstrate significant performance gains within Key Performance Areas (KPA). -The programs monitors the maturity progress of the constituting OIs on a maturity scale (V1, V2, V3 maturity levels introduced by the European Operational Concept Validation Methodology) and revisits their priority in accordance with their maturity status. - The achievement of each maturity level corresponds to a phase, and the transition from a maturity level to the next is assessed on the basis of maturity criteria. - Each maturity criterion shall be demonstrated though evidences , relying on validation results. - Maturity criteria reflect the confidence that the Requirements attached to OIs will be met. In particular, the confidence in meeting the performance targets (considered as a particular category of requirements) is a key maturity criterion: therefore, the accuracy of the performance results (based on platform measurements) supports the estimation of the confidence that the performance target will be met. So, the maturity progress includes derisking the level of performance. - For each OIs, a validation strategy is defined to ensure that the proper validation activities are planned by the relevant projects and aligned with programme priorities. The SESAR Research and Development methodology therefore implements a progressive de-risking / Validation approach, considering the performance gains and confidence to support the maturity assessment. This approach permits to efficiently drive the program on Performance, by re-allocating, when necessary, the resources to the most significantly promising performance gains. To give an example, let us consider two key performance areas: safety (characterized by a number of near-collisions or runway incursions) and capacity (characterized for example by a number of flights in airspace volume or runway movements per hour). Some performance figures, exploring several operational scenarios can be early obtained by fast time simulations and Monte-Carlo analysis. Initial performance results may be sufficient to support trade-offs between performance features, and to feed cost-benefit analysis supporting a decision to proceed or not (or rather to increase/ decrease the priority). Conversely, real flights with representative equipment in all the systems that contribute to the considered OIs may be costly and not suited to explore the solution performance in all relevant scenarios (e.g. nominal and offnominal situations). So, exercises with real flights in representative operational environment will be mostly suited to assess maturity areas remaining to be validated (such as human factors).",,,scopus

2013,Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) applied through a sysML model to the mascot asteroid lander,"Modern space systems engineering practices, such as the use of concurrent design and international and inter- organisational teams, require effective and reliable communication. A shift towards Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) may provide a more effective way for systems engineers to manage and document project progress, while also simplifying project handover. By constructing a Systems Modelling Language (SysML) model of the MASCOT asteroid lander system, the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) has demonstrated the applicability of MBSE to such a project. SysML, developed by the International Council On Systems Engineering (INCOSE) and the Object Management Group (OMG), is a general-purpose graphical modelling language that can be used to construct descriptive models of complex space systems and systems of systems. By providing a descriptive model, SysML can reduce ambiguity and the likelihood of misinterpreted information. The recursive nature of SysML models allows for a simple top down approach to modelling and quick access to the relevant model sections. DLR applied SysML to a shadow study of MASCOT, which allowed access to the knowledge and key personnel of the MASCOT project without putting the MBSE approach on the critical path. The modelling followed a top- down approach and allowed for the building of model knowledge in parallel to the recursive nature of design evolution. The study focussed on the application of SysML based MBSE in phase B and C of project development. A difficult learning curve was seen, which required an investment of time and resources before SysML based MBSE could be implemented. Additionally, a standard modelling methodology needs to be addressed, either within individual organisations, or at the industry level, before it can be implemented. SysML based MBSE was judged to be particularly effective in aiding communication, documentation and monitoring system interaction.

Those that last longer do so because of their importance for society - energy, healthcare, policing and justice, food and agriculture are examples.

2013,A system of systems approach to the evolutionary transformation of power management systems,"Power management systems of the future will be very different from the ones today. They will be complex systems of systems that directly incorporate distributed energy resources into the scheduling processes, react much quicker to changes in power demand and production than today's, and will allow small groups of producers and consumers to participate in the power market. This will lead to a more flexible, robust, and scalable power grid if the technological challenges can be mastered. We propose techniques that support this transition in five evolutionary steps, incorporating proven as well as new ideas. These steps are founded in the belief that agency of system components like power plants, trust as a measure of uncertainty, and self-organisation will be the keys to tackle the challenges at hand.

2012,Grounded theory: An inductive method for supply chain research,"Purpose: Development of theory remains an essential step in the evolution of supply chain management as an integrative business discipline. Supply chain research often involves phenomena possessing complex behavioral dimensions at both the individual and organizational levels.

2013,Distributed combat system of systems network modeling,"How to generate the topology model of Distributed combat System of Systems network is an important issue in combat analysis. A combat network construction algorithm was proposed to solve the problem. The improved hierarchy network evolving method was used to construct the command and control network, and the combat network generation algorithm was developed by the growth and local priority connections of new node joining into the command network. And then the analytical expression of the degree distribution of the network model was deduced via the mean-field theory method. Finally, the network model was analyzed according to the topology statistical parameters. The analyzing results show that under the same command span, though the command network topology doesn't change when command level was increased, but the topology performance of the combat network is improved. This is in line with actual combat network; the comparison of degree distribution of analytical results and simulation results indicated that the degree distribution of network model we proposed follows a power law distribution, with exponential value depending on the initial number of command and control network and the number of nodes connected to the rest of the network, verifying the validity of the algorithm model. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.",10.4304/jnw.8.8.1906-1912,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=51a9703639e8e58a9a00ad5eecdb5781e7cb8e9e#page=228,scopus; googlescholar
2012,Developing a methodology to support the evolution of System of Systems using risk analysis,"The potential for uncontrolled evolution of member systems is one of the most significant challenges facing SoS (System of Systems) management. Lack of control in evolution makes organizations more inefficient, raises costs, and can affect their ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstance. SoS bring together individual systems to fulfill shared goals, but the systems are likely to have been developed independently, and to different development and operational standards. Member systems retain much of their autonomy, along with their motivations and goals. This increases the risk of decisions relating to evolution being taken unilaterally within member systems, potentially to the detriment of the stability, efficiency and dependability of the SoS. This paper proposes a methodology to support non specialist end users in the identification, organization and discussion of information required to manage SoS evolution, and uses a modified form of HAZOPS (Hazard and Operability Study) to analyze the associated risks of evolution. The paper evaluates the methodology using a case study based on a recent RAF (Royal Air Force) Nimrod air crash, the official investigation into which showed severe failings in the operation of the Nimrod SoS. The paper concludes that the methodology proposed would provide valuable support to SoS evolution processes, and discusses future directions for the research. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.20194,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.20194,scopus; wiley; webofscience; googlescholar
2012,Prevalence of pathologies in systems of systems,"As system of systems engineering (SoSE) continues to mature and evolve as a field, there is a natural search for transcending themes and perspectives. The confluence of these themes and perspectives will serve to both distinguish as well as integrate the field. The purpose of this paper is to suggest advancement of the SoSE field by offering an emerging set of common systems-based pathologies that may be prevalent in systems of systems. These pathologies are explored as deviations from the healthy functioning of an effective system of systems, potentially constraining performance, wasting resources, and reducing the level of system viability (sustaining existence). Upon recognising these pathologies, implications for utilising systems theory-based principles to aid in understanding their manifestation, systemic assessment, and strategies for system redesign to address the pathologies are explored. This paper concludes with implications and further development of research and practice related to pathologies in the developing SoSE field.

2012,Introducing systems engineering concepts in a senior capstone design course,"Senior capstone design projects can often expand in complexity to include systems of systems, particularly in projects involving embedded systems to control a larger system. Principles of Systems Engineering (SE) can be integrated into the capstone course to help students-who may not have been exposed previously-manage this increased complexity. This paper presents an evolving framework of essential SE fundamental elements, including the top-level processes of Requirements Analysis, Functional Analysis and Allocation, Design or Synthesis, and Analysis & Control. A case study of a mechatronic system (a robotic tin whistle player) was used in a two-semester Electrical and Computer Engineering capstone design course in which the students had no prior exposure to formal SE processes. The students still had to design, build and test their projects' systems, so a balance had to be struck between teaching basic SE principles with its various reporting opportunities, and leaving enough time to do the hands-on engineering required to produce a prototype at the end of the year. The result is a capstone design course that exposes students to the language of SE so that they will be able to recognize its processes when encountered after graduation. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.",,,scopus; webofscience

Following the principles of event-driven and service-oriented architectures, the system is able to provide novel yet coherent behaviour and features based on a dynamic self-organization. The process of selforganization is established on the basis of autonomous and concurrent tasks that are enacted by choreographies specifying the expected behaviour of the participating components. Although the individual systems are able to act completely independently, their interactions expose emergent structures of evolving nature in a process of reorganizing their network. By the specification of global conversations, maintained in commonly available semantic registries it is possible to establish a federation of systems that is able to adapt its behaviour to unforeseen events like partly system failures.",10.1109/ISADS.2013.6513440,,scopus
2012,Exploitation/attacks within the radio frequency spectrum,"Radio frequency (RF) and Computer Network Exploitation and Attacks (CNE/CNA) can no longer be viewed as separate activities or actions within the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum for military or commercial operations. Integration of Internet Protocol (IP) capabilities allowing for node addressing, data transfer, and communications between systems once considered only Electronic Warfare (EW)-centric, may provide nationstate and non-nation-state adversaries and opportunistic malicious hackers the ability to exploit systems previously considered autonomous. Furthermore, network operations can be affected from wireless and remotely-operating RF systems associated to, or trusted with, operational networks. Basic RF jamming techniques provide an adversary the ability to affect blue force IP over radio communications and data transmissions with little or no risk to themselves by obfuscating their efforts as an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer 2-6 attack rather than a layer 1 attack. The Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC) Vulnerability Assessment Team (JVAT) performs adversarial red team tactics against developmental Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs), to include CNE/CNA and RF system of systems. The evolution of 'smart' weapons technologies, to include most information operations (IO) capabilities, now represents the norm in systems development. Command and control (C ) and common operational pictures (COPs) with integrated IP over radio, provide multiple attack vectors and unique opportunities for adversaries. Organizations that manage and develop EW and/or wireless networks must adapt policies and organizational processes to meet the changing environment and to deal with an increasingly savvy adversary who only requires open-source tools and technologies to successfully attack sophisticated RF networked systems. In this paper the authors identify adversarial tactics used against developmental systems with integrated EW and CNO capabilities; using only open-source and publically available equipment, data, and technologies. The authors will also discuss adversarial techniques from three case studies based on actual red teaming assessments on developmental systems.",,,scopus

In part, due to the principle of finite causality introduced in this paper, stating no system outcome can have infinitely bad (or good) implications; thus, the outcome of any action or series of actions is finite in nature. This realisation further bolsters the acceptability of an inherently sub-optimal SoS. This paper explores the notions of why optimisation of a SoS is both: 1) unattainable based on its inherent characteristics and associated systems principles; and 2) unnecessary in practice.

2013,Agent-Based Modeling for Systems of Systems,"Agent-based modeling is an important tool for the engineering of systems of systems. This paper briefly reviews the historical development of agent-based modeling and system of systems concepts, compares agent-based modeling to other approaches, and describes the Purdue Discrete Agent Framework for agent-based modeling. An application of the Discrete Agent Framework to a system of systems is described and illustrates the ability of agent-based modeling to capture non-intuitive behaviors that may arise due to the complex dynamics that occur in interconnected systems of agents that follow a behavioral set of rules. The paper concludes by looking back to the past to understand the potential for applying agent-based modeling to support the ongoing engineering and operations of an evolving system of systems. © 2013 by Ankur Mour, C.

2012,Evolving robust networks for systems-of-systems,"Software systems that rely on ad-hoc networks are becoming increasingly complex and increasingly prevalent. Some of these systems provide vital functionality to military operations, emergency services and disaster relief; such systems may have significant impact on the safety of people involved in those operations. It is therefore important that those networks support critical software requirements, including those for latency of packet transfer. If a network ceases to meet the software's requirements (e.g. due to a link failure) then engineers must be able to understand it well enough to reconfigure the network and restore it to a requirement-satisfying state. Given a complex network, it is difficult for a human to do this under time pressure. In this paper we present a search-based tool which takes a network defined using the Network Description Language (NDL), annotated with a set of network-hosted applications and a set of latency requirements between each. We then evolve variants of the network configuration which meet the requirements and are robust to single link failures. We use network calculus tools to get a fast, conservative evaluation of whether a given network meets its requirements. We demonstrate that this approach is viable, designs networks much faster than a human engineer could, and is superior to a random generate-and-test approach. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/978-3-642-33119-0_4,,scopus; springerlink
2012,The role of synergy in the evolution of living systems,"Living Systems Theory (LST), as well as System of Systems Processes Theory (SSP), and other theory and research in the systems sciences and complexity science have illuminated many aspects of how living systems work - Their mechanisms, processes and relationships. The Synergism Hypothesis, originally proposed in 1983, addresses the evolution of ""cooperation"" in nature and why there has been a secular trend over time toward increased complexity in living systems. The theory highlights the role of functional synergy - Adaptively significant combined effects that are interdependent and otherwise unattainable - in shaping the ""progressive"" emergence of complex living systems, an approach that is entirely consistent with modern evolutionary biology and natural selection theory. It is thus radically opposed to various orthogenetic/deterministic theories of complexity that have been proposed over the years. This theory has recently gained scientific support, and there is growing appreciation for the role of various kinds of synergy as an influence in the evolutionary process.",,,scopus
2009,A proposal for the development of an enterprise architecture model of the next generation air transportation system,"Anticipating significant growth in aircraft operations over the next 16 years, the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) released in June 2007 a Concept of Operations document that describes how the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) might operate in 2025. As envisioned, NextGen will require development of a complex, netcentric system of systems in which existing systems must be merged seamlessly with new systems and technologies. Systems of this kind present formidable risks and difficulties in their design, construction, deployment, and evolution. As a way of reducing these risks and addressing these difficulties, Boeing developed and patented our Enterprise System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) Process. This process combines a model-based approach with the framework of the traditional systems engineering process to create an entirely new architecture-centric, stakeholder-driven system architecture development tool. For a system of systems like NextGen, the SoSE Process would result in a seamless description of the system architecture from the enterprise goals and objectives down to each of the constituent system's configuration items and could provide an ideal framework for the iterative and evolutionary process the JPDO envisions for development of the air transportation system of the future.

2011,Inter-disciplinary interoperability for global sustainability research,"The implementation of the INSPIRE Directive in Europe and similar efforts around the globe to develop spatial data infrastructures and global systems of systems have been focusing largely on the adoption of agreed technologies, standards, and specifications to meet the (systems) interoperability challenge. Addressing the key scientific challenges of humanity in the 21st century requires however a much increased inter-disciplinary effort, which in turn makes more complex demands on the type of systems and arrangements needed to support it. This paper analyses the challenges for inter-disciplinary interoperability using the experience of the EuroGEOSS research project. It argues that inter-disciplinarity requires mutual understanding of requirements, methods, theoretical underpinning and tacit knowledge, and this in turn demands for a flexible approach to interoperability based on mediation, brokering and semantics-aware, cross-thematic functionalities. The paper demonstrates the implications of adopting this approach and charts the trajectory for the evolution of current spatial data infrastructures. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/978-3-642-20630-6_1,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

These anti-system communities are loosely coupled multi-agent systems bound only by shared learning loops of tools, techniques and targets. Contemporary system security strategy is failing against this intelligent operational evolution. The need for next generation security strategies is fueling early action. One avenue is crafting new standards and new acquisition requirements-another avenue is probing security structures that mirror the adversarial architectures of self-organizing systems-of-systems.

This system must not only support communication between actors, but also coordinate their activities. It might be considered like a system of systems for which interoperability between partners is a key factor. As a main component of such a critical system, a Mediation Information System (MIS) is defined at the core of the ISyCri architecture, with the aim to coordinate actors' services and information exchange. Because a crisis is intrinsically an evolutionary phenomenon, the system shall remain compliant with the expectations of the actors.

2010,How to grasp emerging futures of information wars?,"In industrial war, the objective was to win the trial of strength and thereby break the enemy's will. In the information age military force is used to influence the intentions of people. Globalisation and networking of operational environments constantly change the traditional order of management. Military organisations are challenged to behave more dynamically and to enhance the knowledge base being more multidisciplinary and agile. The societies today are ""systems of systems"", i.e. complex interactive human-technological systems forming various dynamic multidimensional networks. Thus, the complexity of interactions can only be tracked using conditional probabilities. This makes the decision-making of operations all the more dependent on tacit knowledge of the officers all through the various levels of command-and-control. Human behaviour cannot be forecast in detail, since people can change their rules of interaction thus changing expected outcome. In the past, the general understanding of ontology has been that there are two - order and chaos. Recently the third ontology - complexity - has emerged in scientific approach. In complex systems there is order, but it is emergent rising from the local interaction of independent actors, each of whom behaves according to its own principles, logic and knowledge. The behaviour of complex evolving systems and organisations arises from the intricate interconnectivity of elements - independent actors - within the system and between the system and its operational environment. In this paper, the futures research methodology for creating alternative futures images of information wars is presented. There are recent major efforts to upgrade foresight methodologies available for the global community, such as organisational complexity, six-to-seven pillars of futures methods, HIF-analysis (Hindsight/Insight/Foresight), sense-making and Futures Signals Sense-making Framework (FSSF).

2010,A proposed missile defense test bed using the Umbra simulation framework,"There are a large number of models that predict the behavior of electronic warfare (EW) weapons systems and their components. Most of these model a single sensor, source, or environmental characteristic. However, multi-sensor technology is becoming increasingly common and the battlefield is constantly evolving, leading to new tactical situations. To meet the rapidly changing operational requirements, new EW systems are often added to current operational architectures, either federated or fully integrated. In particular, self-protection countermeasures are retrofitted into operational aircraft to add a capability that was not available or thought not to be necessary when the aircraft was built. Consequently we add into the initial self-protection suite of the aircraft without a good tool to evaluate how the new component will operate as part of the new system of systems. To support test and evaluation planning and analysis, we need an architecture that will allow models to be combined within the same simulation framework. ORION addresses this problem with the Umbra simulation framework, developed by ORION and Sandia National Laboratories. Umbra addresses the ""middle layer"" of simulation between high-level mission analysis tools such as DIS & HLA-based military simulators and low-level engineering analysis tools such as MATLAB. A key element is its ability to model the topology of the integrated system being simulated, allowing simulations with asymmetrical levels of fidelity/detail and a progression from simplified conceptual exploration to realistic hardware-in-the loop or constructive simulations. This also enables Umbra to quickly incorporate existing models. ORION and Sandia have developed a module library which covers areas important in EW modeling, including RF propagation, battlefield communications networks, and autonomous land and air vehicles. Finally, Umbra was designed with scalability as a primary goal. This paper explores the use of Umbra in EW simulation by investigating the feasibility of integrating several existing models relevant to the AN/AAR-47 missile defense system. Although we have chosen a specific optical system for our initial demonstration, the applicability of the Umbra simulation and integration framework covers all EW.",,,scopus

The problem is approached in the spirit of the Leontief tradition within the framework of the Inoperability Input/Output Modelling [6] where, instead of dealing with the sector products, inoperabilities are introduced to describe the status of the global system. A Markov Chain evolution law replaces Leontief equilibrium condition upon external changes, thus allowing to follow the transition from an equilibrium configuration to an other and possibly mimic cascade effects triggered by unwilled disturbances. Moreover, as a variation to the ""System of Systems"" approach, each network is not treated like an holomorphic entity, but its inner structure is inspected. Multiple implementations of the same scenarios at different level of granularity have been compared providing evidence for intrinsic inconsistency of models disregarding the geographic distribution of networks. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/978-3-642-14379-3_1,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2010,The global nuclear detection architecture: Issues for Congress,"The U.S. government has implemented a series of programs to protect the nation against terrorist nuclear attack. Some of these programs predate September 11, 2001, while others were established since then. Most programs are within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State; and agencies that became part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) upon its creation, and they are focused on detecting the illicit acquisition and shipment of nuclear and radiological materials and protecting and securing nuclear weapons. These disparate programs have historically been viewed as lacking coordination and centralized oversight. In 2005, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) was established within the Department of Homeland Security to centralize coordination of the federal response to an unconventional nuclear threat. The office was codified in 2006 through the passage of the SAFEPort Act (P.L. 109-347) and given specific statutory responsibilities to protect the United States against radiological and nuclear attack, including the responsibility to develop a ""global nuclear detection architecture."" Determining the range of existing federal efforts protecting against nuclear attack, coordinating the outcomes of these efforts, identifying overlaps and gaps between them, and integrating the results into a single architecture are likely to be evolving, ongoing tasks. The global nuclear detection architecture is a multi-layered system of detection technologies, programs, and guidelines designed to enhance the nation's ability to detect and prevent a radiological or nuclear attack. Among its components are existing programs in nuclear detection operated by other federal agencies and new programs put into place by DNDO. The global nuclear detection architecture is developed by DNDO in coordination with other federal agencies implementing nuclear detection efforts and this coordination is essential to the success of the architecture.This architecture is a complicated system of systems. Measuring the success of the architecture relative to its individual components and the effectiveness of additional investments are challenges. The DNDO is developing risk and cost methodologies to be applied to the architecture in order to understand and prioritize the various nuclear detection programs and activities in multiple federal agencies. Congress, in its oversight capacity, has shown interest in the development and implementation of the global nuclear detection architecture and in the decision-making process attendant to investments in it. Other issues that may be foci of congressional attention include the balance between investment in near-term and long-term solutions for architecture gaps, the degree and efficacy of federal agency coordination, the mechanism for setting agency investment priorities in the architecture, and the efforts DNDO has undertaken to retain institutional knowledge regarding this sustained architecture effort. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

2011,Defense acquisitions: How dod acquires weapon systems and recent efforts to reform the process,"Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to acquire goods and services are often complex and controversial. These efforts are referred to as defense acquisitions. The structure DOD utilizes to plan, execute, and oversee those activities is an intricate and multivariate ""system of systems"" composed of the requirements, resource allocation, and acquisition systems. This system of systems has evolved over time, its foundation being the report published by the Packard Commission in 1986, many of whose recommendations became part of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. This evolution continued, as the requirements system changed from a threat-based to a capabilities-based system; the resource allocation system added execution reviews and concurrent program/budget reviews; and the acquisition system became a flexible, tailored process. The complexity of this system of systems combined with the magnitude of personnel, activities and funding involved in its operation can result in problems, including inefficient operations, fraud/waste/abuse, and inadequate implementation or enforcement of the laws and regulations that govern it. Both DOD and Congress have worked to address these types of problems and accompanying issues over the years. On April 21, 2010, the House Armed Services Committee unanimously voted in support of the Implementing Management for Performance and Related Reforms to Obtain Value in Every Acquisition Act of 2009 (H.R. 5013). While the act focuses primarily on the acquisition workforce, DOD's internal financial management, and the industrial base, some sections of the proposed bill relate directly to weapon system acquisition. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, a number of major efforts were undertaken to reform the acquisition progress. DOD issued an updated and revised DOD Instruction 5000.2 (which governs the process for acquiring systems) and issued an updated and revised Instruction, Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (which governs the process for deciding what capabilities new weapon systems require). In addition, Secretary Gates stated his intent to significantly alter the way weapon systems are acquired, including canceling or curtailing the acquisition of a number of current programs. For its part, the 110th Congress passed the FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act (S. 3001/P.L. 110-417) and the 111th Congress passed the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (S. 454/P.L. 111-23), both of which made changes to the acquisition process. Key provisions in P.L. 111-23 include the appointment of a Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, a Director of Developmental Test and Evaluation, and a Director of Systems Engineering; a requirement that combatant commanders have more influence in the requirements generation process; changes to the Nunn-McCurdy Act, including rescinding the most recent Milestone approval for any program experiencing critical cost growth; and a requirement that DOD revise guidelines and tighten regulations governing conflicts of interest by contractors working on MDAPs. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Taking a SoS perspective of largescale infrastructural development can be beneficial in better understanding the inherent problems of emergent complexity. SoS is a relatively new term that is being applied primarily to addressing large scale inter-disciplinary developmental challenges with multiple, heterogeneous, and distributed networkcentric systems. A large-scale infrastructural system can be hierarchically structured from its building blocks to higher multi-levels of network. An infrastructural SoS is usually developed in evolutionary stages integrating existing systems with upgraded or extended systems. Complex infrastructural systems are non-monolithic and they share certain common characteristics which can be developed into a set of discriminators to develop a framework for SoS engineering management addressing issues in an evolutionary planning and staged development, stakeholder management and leadership for complex systems integration.

It defines the structure, the conceptual model of the federation, the set of rules imposed to the federation members, the global tasks of the federation, the envelope functions and the offered services, preserving in the meantime all the individual systems functionally which are improved by integration synergy. The federation assures the management support of interconnected individual critical systems, using different technologies and methods to enable the participation of existing stand-alone SCADA systems to the federation, in order to provide an added value, the interoperability of the resulted enhanced-system. The concept may be prospectively exploited in order to carry out the integration among several evolving critical SCADA systems.

Next-generation tools and technologies are vehicles toward personalized medicine, extending the telemedicine model to include cell phones and Internet-based telecommunications tools for remote and home health management with video assessment, remote bedside monitoring, and patient-specific care tools with event logs, patient electronic profile, and physician note-writing capability. Telehealth is ultimately a system of systems in scale and complexity. To cover the full spectrum of dynamic and evolving needs of end-users, we must appreciate system complexity as telehealth moves toward increasing functionality, integration, interoperability, outreach, and quality of service. Toward that end, our group addressed three overarching questions: (1) What are the high-impact topics? (2) What are the barriers to progress? and (3) What roles can the National Institutes of Health and its various institutes and centers play in fostering the future development of telehealth? © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",10.1089/tmj.2009.0153,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/tmj.2009.0153,scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2011,Modeling software engineering challenges of C4I systems using assurance cases,"Command Control, Communication Computer and Intelligence (C4I) systems are the backbone systems for information warfare (IW) which helps the military commander by presenting an integrated picture of the battlefield. C4I are complex System of systems (SOS) where individual systems interact locally to achieve global SOS behaviors. Engineering Complex software intensive systems is a challenge due to continuous growth, evolution and new set of operational requirements. Systems in SOS context introduce significant sources of risks and challenges. This paper highlights SOS challenges and risks that limit the scope of traditional software engineering (SE) practices and methodologies. Assurance cases are the modeling tool based on claim-argument and evidence structure. We have used assurance cases to model SOS (SE) challenges in order to enhance (SE) practices and techniques to minimize risks and challenges associated with SOS based C4I systems.",,,scopus
2009,"Improving the practice of systems engineering, boot strapping grass roots success","This paper describes how to use a positive devianceinspired process for improving the practice of systems engineering, and how positive deviance fits into an evolutionary improvement strategy. It illustrates the process with examples from both systems engineering and cases studies outside of systems engineering. In particular we cite the experience of the team that authored the DoD Systems Engineering Guide for Systems of Systems (SoS) [Ref 1]. They developed a representation of how successful SoS engineering practitioners view and do systems engineering that is substantially different from their individual system counterparts. The cases outside of systems engineering relate to an antistarvation program in rural Vietnam and a 150-year old problem of inadequate hand scrubbing and infections in hospitals [Ref 2]. Even with substantial progress in technology, processes, and efficiencies, complex problems from enterprise systems engineering to nutrition to medical needs still stubbornly resist improvement. By using a positive deviance-inspired approach, this can be reversed. © 2009 IEEE.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2009.4815820,,scopus
2010,Hardware/software codesign of aerospace and automotive systems,"Electronics systems for modern vehicles must be designed to meet stringent requirements on real-time performance, safety, power consumption, and security. Hardware/software codesign techniques allow system designers to create platforms that can both meet those requirements and evolve as components and system requirements evolve. Design methodologies have evolved that allow systems-of-systems to be built from subsystems that are themselves embedded computing systems. Software performance is a key metric in the design of these systems. A number of methods-of-methods for the analysis of worst case execution time have been developed. More recently, we have developed new methods for software performance analysis based on design of experiments. Formal methods can be used to verify system properties. Systems must be architected to maintain their integrity in the face of attacks from the Internet. All of these techniques build upon generic hardware/software codesign techniques but with significant adaptations to the technical and economic context of vehicle design. © 2010 IEEE.",10.1109/JPROC.2009.2036747,,scopus; webofscience

2011,Constraint-based modelling and optimization to support the design of complex multi-domain engineering problems,"We present a constraint-based methodology which is successfully applied to a variety of engineering problems from a wide range of disciplines. Initially conceived from investigations of the engineering design process, the methodology has helped design engineers to identify and understand the initial limitations placed upon a system. Written as a set of algebraic expressions, the design objectives and design constraints can be formulated and minima found using numerical optimization techniques. These solutions provide initial configurations for the system, corresponding to how ""true"" all of the constraints are. A bespoke constraint-based modelling environment has been created which embodies the methodology. This is able to resolve large systems, comprising over 100 degrees-of-freedom, using an assortment of optimization routines-direct, gradient and evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms are appropriate for a number of problem types and their inclusion increase the scope of applicability of the methodology which is demonstrated using case studies from a number of engineering domains. Machines and mechanisms; human modelling; force and flow; structural geology and discrete disassembly processes are all studied using constraint-based formulations. The contribution of the paper lies in thus proving that complex (heterogeneous) systems-of-systems can be solved if the connectivity between the systems is expressed using constraint-rules. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",10.1007/s00366-010-0201-y,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience
2009,Command & control wind tunnel integration and overview,"A virtual wind tunnel for command and control systems has long been the 'holy grail' of many research and development communities. This paper explores the early design, development and integration of a software testbed for Command and Control (C2) systems called the Command and Control Wind Tunnel. This synthetic environment is intended to model current and future C2 environments, allowing prototype C2 technologies and designs to be tested and evaluated, in a near realistic environment. Building a comprehensive system to represent C2 has many challenges. The C2 problem space is continuously evolving, increasingly complex and fluid. One must consider many factors, including people, processes, systems, data, and relationships, in order to model it. This system of systems must loosely couple disparate models and simulation engines; enable the use of real world data across multiple models expressed in different modeling languages; and still allow for rapid system configuration and integration. At the end of this paper the reader will understand the goals and ideals of the C2 Wind Tunnel, what technologies are going into the design of the Wind Tunnel, the status of the current prototype, and the next planned steps to achieve the C2 Wind Tunnel environment.",,,scopus

These efforts are referred to as defense acquisitions. The structure DOD utilizes to plan, execute, and oversee those activities is an intricate and multivariate ""system of systems"" composed of the requirements, resource allocation, and acquisition systems. This system of systems has evolved over time, its foundation being the report published by the Packard Commission in 1986, many of whose recommendations became part of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.

2011,Niteworks: Systems thinking and methods within a collaboration paradigm,"Like many complex enterprises, UK Defence is struggling with a series of frustrating organisational, system and technology problems, including: increasing scale and complexity, increasing need for continuous capability evolution and increasing need to optimise at the system of systems level. Within this context, Niteworks provides flexible decision support to address three priority areas: support to current operations; support to decision making by the Joint Capabilities Board (JCB), and; support to complex acquisition. This paper describes Niteworks' unique collaborative partnership construct that allows UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) and industry engagement in aneutral, consensus-based, yet agile manner to address a wide range of complex decision support activities. It details the enabling commercial arrangements, the underlying principles for success and a generic decision model. This approach, the 'Niteworks Way', has been designed by applying systems engineering thinking and methods to the Defence Enterprise and Niteworks within it. The approach has been demonstrated to be flexible and responsive by addressing issues across the range of the UK Defence Enterprise. It has also delivered sizeable value to both UK MOD and industry, demonstrating that collaborations can work effectively and that both industry and the MOD can benefit from embracing new concepts and commercial arrangements. © 2011.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2011.tb01219.x,,scopus; wiley
2010,A systems approach to architect coherent system of systems capabilities,"Architecting of coherent system-of-systems (SoS) capabilities is complex due factors such as the diverse range of stakeholders and evolving requirements. Left to themselves, these individual stakeholders at the system requirements definition and implementation stages may demand for optimization of individual systems of their interests. This would collectively result in local optimization at the system-level at the expense of SoS-level or even enterpriselevel effectiveness. This paper proposes an approach to coherently architect SoS capabilities. This approach is premised on the assumption that a ""top-down"" leadership approach is applicable to establish the required reporting structures and relationships in the technical community. The approach attempts to weave in the considerations of limited shared resources and common technological solutions across the national defense enterprise into the process of architecting an SoS that would fulfil a large-scale mission capability. © 2010 by Yeoh Lean Weng and Chia Ban Seng.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2010.tb01140.x,,scopus; wiley

The purpose of this paper is to develop a perspective of the state of the SoSE field and identify challenges for future evolution. To achieve this purpose, the paper is organised to explore four primary areas. First, the literature is reviewed to provide an account of the current state of the field. Second, an organising framework is presented to structure understanding of field development. Third, a set of challenges to forward movement of the field is offered.

The mission and contents of this new discipline were introduced. Knowledge system is considered as ""the system of systems"" since most of the component systems is existing and they can be operated and managed independently. Integration of existing systems together with newly developed system will constitute the system of systems and new functions will emerge.The network models are widely used in knowledge systems and ""system of systems"" can be modeled and analyzed by the ""network of networks"" or so called supernetwork approach. The architectures of knowledge systems were suggested. They are (1) organizational architecture, (2) personnel architecture, (3) technological architecture, (4) business architecture, (5) cultural architecture. The working processes of knowledge system, including the knowledge acquisition, organizing, discovery, creation and utilization were analyzed. Some new concepts of knowledge conversion opposed to dichotomy approach, based on knowledge spectrum approach, were presented and integration of incremental and catastrophic evolution of knowledge creation model was suggested. The features and advantages of innovation by system-integration and its thinking styles were described. Finally the architectural features of knowledge systems engineering in accordance with the framework of Qian's taxonomy were discussed.",,,scopus
2010,Constructing program management framework: A system of systems approach,"Programs are aimed at achieving long term objectives that create value to stakeholders. They consist of a portfolio of projects, each of which aims at achieving specific sub-goals. A program emerges as a system of systems (SoS) when these projects are connected in a systemic way to accomplish program objectives. This entails that programs have an architecture that defines how the various projects interact to accomplish the overall objectives. Current program management approaches, however, largely treat programs as a collection of projects that are managed operationally to optimize outcomes at each level, rather than as a system to be architected. This paper develops a systemic architecture for programs in terms of three interconnected facets: value realization, program construction and program execution, and highlights the role of program worldview in this. Each of these facets brings out some aspects of the way in which projects relate to each other within a program. We propose an iterative framework in which models are developed for addressing each facet, but there is also an overall structure of activity and information flows that facilitates interplay and co-evolution of the models. The result is a holistic approach to managing programs as a system of systems, at a level over and above project management. ©2010 IEEE.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482471,,scopus

Based on a critical review of Building Product Modelling, including the development of standards for exchange and the features of over 150 AEC/O (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) tools and digital models, a methodological framework is proposed for improvements to both BIM tools and schemata. The features relevant to the framework were studied using a conceptual process model and a 'BIM System-of-Systems' (BIM-SoS) model. The development, implementation, and use of the BIM Schema are analysed from the standpoint of standardisation. The results embrace the requirements for a BIM research methodology, with an example of methods and procedures, an R&D review with critique, and a multi-standpoint framework for developments with concrete recommendations, supported by BIM metrics, upon which the progress of tools, models, and standards may be measured, evaluated, streamlined, and judged. It is also proposed that any BIM Schema will never be 'completed' but should be developed as evolutionary ontology by 'segmented standpoint models' to better account for evolving tools and AEC/O practices. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2011,A modelling approach for interdependency in digital systems-of-systems security - Extended abstract,"There is little doubt that the proper functioning of our modern society depends upon cyberspace, and that the continued growth in appetite for new technology and the potential benefits associated with it shows little sign of abating. Unfortunately the reality of modern information and communications systems involves a complex array of hardware, middleware, software, communications protocols and services, operated by a diverse set of stakeholders (users and providers each with a heterogeneous set of changing motives (including personal, enterprise, or societal gains). Everyday services that we take for granted often rely on complex interdependent systems, with the result that a seemingly unrelated failure in one of the subsystems, invisible to the service consumer, may lead to an all too visible collapse of the service that they expect. In the context of information and network risk management this complexity means that it is currently very difficult to predict how an organisation might be impacted by vulnerabilities being exploited or failures accidentally manifesting elsewhere in a system. Additionally, organisations responsible for subsystems are likely to evolve different risk-management cultures and practice, making their adoption and use of network and information risk controls (and consequences for other interdependent subsystems) difficult to predict. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/978-3-642-21694-7_13,,scopus; springerlink
2010,Development of modular mission packages providing focused warfighting capability for the Littoral Combat Ship,"The US Navy has been involved in the development of a new class of combatant ship called the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The LCS is designed to operate more effectively in the littoral environment by providing enhanced maneuverability through the seaframe's inherent ability to operate at high speeds and in shallow waters. Additionally, to counter the high threat environment of the littorals and to enhance the mission commander's options at reasonable cost, the LCS is designed to augment its core self-defense capability with modular mission packages (MPs) that provide focused warfighting capabilities. The LCS MPs are classified as systems-of-systems (SoSs) as they are made up of: mission systems, support equipment, software, mission crew detachments, and aviation systems; and then integrated into a larger SoS to deliver unique capability. To support the accelerated development schedule, PMS 420 is using an evolutionary acquisition process to provide continuous improvements in warfighting capability over time. The initial MP increments are specifically designed to augment the warfighting areas of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Countermeasures (MCM), and Surface Warfare (SUW). Modularity, an open business model, and open system architectures are key enablers supporting the future insertion of new technologies into the MP baseline. The paper will provide a brief overview of the LCS seaframe designs as they impact MP development, but will focus on the development and maturation of the MPs as SoSs. A definition of what composes an MP will be presented along with the perceived benefits and challenges of developing focused warfighting capability separate from the seaframe design. The present status of the SUW, ASW, and MCMMPs will be reviewed as well as their respective incremental development plans. The joint developmental relationship between PMS 420 and PMS 501 will be discussed with respect to the definition and management of seaframe-MP interfaces. The techniques and methodologies used by PMS 420 in controlling SoS development and evaluating the technical and programmatic performance of the three MPs will be presented. The extensive use of the government laboratories to fulfill the lead system integration role will be presented and the methodology used by PMS 420 in transitioning technologies developed by PMS 420 and or other program offices for incorporation into MPs will be reviewed. © 2011, American Society of Naval Engineers.",10.1111/j.1559-3584.2010.00281.x,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2009,The benefits of multi-constellation GNSS: Reaching up even to single constellation GNSS users,"The scenario of GNSS is speeding up on a no-return track towards a multi-constellation and multi-frequency GNSS world. On top of the good-ole-boy GPS, the re-bom GLONASS system is steadily improving. The exciting perspectives of new global systems as Galileo or Compass are getting closer to reality. Regional systems as QZSS or IRNSS are also on the starting line. Augmentation systems flourish worldwide: WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, GAGAN... Within this seemingly chaotic scenario of possibilities, some initiatives are actively working on the definition of efficient, pragmatic and user-oriented approaches to take advantage of this new challenging scenario into a maximum-benefit scheme for all GNSS users. In particular Europe has launched, under ESA's European GNSS Evolution Programme, the MRS initiative. MRS standing for Multi-constellation/ multi-frequency Regional System, the initiative is putting different teams of experts into the exciting goal of defining the paths for the most successful GNSS usage on a future of multiple choices. Following this approach and based on the promising study results obtained so far by ESA (see ref [1]) MRS is increasingly becoming a serious and natural candidate for the evolution of the current EGNOS System which is qualified and in operations since 3 years and which delivers both an Open Service and a Safety Of Life aeronautical service (same as WAAS). EGNOS is on the way to certification planned for mid 2010. But MRS is not just looking far in the wonderful future of several matured GNSS systems. Also the present and short term future are being taken into account, based on what we have today and aiming to improve the services that we are already providing to ourselves today, as GNSS users. Today we do have already a multi-constellation scenario, with GLONASS getting close to having the nominal constellation in operation. Furthermore, processing platforms as that of EGNOS, magicSBAS or SPEED [2] already implement the ability of processing GLONASS data into an SBAS solution. Based on these available tools, ESA has prepared a detailed experimentation plan aimed to demonstrate the benefits that the multi-constellation approach can provide to today's GNSS users. This plan covers a wide range of objectives covering different user domains (aeronautical, land mobile, maritime) equipped with different types of receivers. This set of experimentations will rely on the deployment of several Test Beds combining multi constellation multi-frequency processing and multi broadcast channels (GEO, MEO, terrestrial). Among the first experimentations planned, there are some devoted to experiment and validate the performance benefits for SBAS users (GPS Ll only first then GPS/GLONASS or GPS/Galileo - L1/E1 mono frequency or dual frequency E1/E5 SBAS users). This paper presents the outcome of the first step of this experimentation campaign, which has been performed based on the magicSBAS tool, a flexible SBAS processing platform, able to acquire single and dual frequency GLONASS data, in addition to GPS, in order to compute and provide both standards SBAS corrections and integrity, as well as augmentation to GLONASS. The objectives of this first step are twofold: 1. Analyse the benefits for single frequency users of using both GPS and GLONASS augmentation, in particular for uncontrolled environments, where the visibility of additional satellites play a key role on the reliability of the GNSS services, as for instance for urban applications. 2. Analyse the potential benefits that can be achieved by improving the standards GPS L1 SBAS augmentation service, when GLONASS data are used within the processing facility to improve the overall accuracy, integrity and continuity of the service. In particular we will analyse how such a dual-frequency/dual constellation processing can improve ionospheric information, by increasing: - accuracy, with more visible satellites - robustness, for instance against scintillation effects - service coverage, by offering improved (more accurate and more available) Ionospheric Grid Point monitoring to users located at the service area boarder; - reliability with better geometry for integrity monitorisation The results of the analysis will be used as a key proof of concept for the definition of the short term evolutions of current European GNSS initiatives, which goes beyond the usage of GLONASS towards the incorporation of Galileo in a truly System of Systems, where all users, including legacy users will be able to exploit the advantages stemming from optimized performances, higher reliability, maximum integrity and seamless navigation. MRS is one of several worldwide initiatives, but it is marching steadily and actively towards its goals, and there is no better way to march than by experimenting, trying and learning from practice.",,,scopus; webofscience

2011,System of systems engineering with the ESA architecture framework,"This paper presents an overview of the ESA Architecture Framework (ESA-AF) and supporting tools which have been developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). A new activity has been started to consolidate and improve ESA-AF and the supporting tools, based on the initial feedback of the different stakeholders. The work is being performed for ESA by VEGA. System of Systems (SoS) Engineering addresses the development and operations of evolving programmes that comprise a collaboration of diverse sets of system assets. SoS engineering has its roots in the defence domain and is increasingly being applied in other complex domains such as air transportation, healthcare and global communication networks. In comparison to systems engineering of monolithic systems, SoS engineering is often performed under some level of uncertainty regarding the requirements and the constituent systems, and involves considerations at multiple levels and domains. While traditional systems engineering seeks to optimise individual systems, SoS engineering normally seeks to optimise a network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives. SoS engineering enables the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time. In order to master the analysis and assessment of existing systems as well as the optimisation of future systems, new methods and technologies must be introduced in the ESA environment. To support the definition of these systems of systems ESA has performed a number of studies in the area of Architecture Frameworks. One of these activities has resulted in the development of ESA-AF, which is based on existing frameworks, such as the UK's Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework (MODAF). ESA-AF has now been applied in pilot activities on a number of large programmes. These include the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Galileo global navigation systems. All of these programmes consist of large complex systems of systems for which ESA-AF is able to provide support. The pilot activities have provided valuable feedback on the application of ESA-AF and this experience is being fed back into the ESA-AF consolidation activity. In the paper we present the ESA-AF meta-model, its governance model and the tools that have been developed to exploit SoS models. We then introduce some of the areas that users of ESA-AF have identified for improvement and how this is driving the current activity to consolidate ESA-AF to better meet ESA's future requirements.

2010,Using SysML for MBSE analysis of the LSST system,"The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is a complex hardware - software system of systems, making up a highly automated observatory in the form of an 8.4m wide-field telescope, a 3.2 billion pixel camera, and a peta-scale data processing and archiving system. As a project, the LSST is using model based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology for developing the overall system architecture coded with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). With SysML we use a recursive process to establish three-fold relationships between requirements, logical & physical structural component definitions, and overall behavior (activities and sequences) at successively deeper levels of abstraction and detail. Using this process we have analyzed and refined the LSST system design, ensuring the consistency and completeness of the full set of requirements and their match to associated system structure and behavior. As the recursion process proceeds to deeper levels we derive more detailed requirements and specifications, and ensure their traceability. We also expose, define, and specify critical system interfaces, physical and information flows, and clarify the logic and control flows governing system behavior. The resulting integrated model database is used to generate documentation and specifications and will evolve to support activities from construction through final integration, test, and commissioning, serving as a living representation of the LSST as designed and built. We discuss the methodology and present several examples of its application to specific systems engineering challenges in the LSST design. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.",10.1117/12.857227,,scopus; webofscience
2011,Towards intelligent search support for web services evolution: Identifying the right abstractions,"Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) is becoming a popular style for building complex systems-of-systems that allow businesses to work together across organizational boundaries. However concerns have been raised about the comprehensibility and maintainability of SOA composite applications. Integrating and deploying SOA applications requires artifacts in a variety of web-based languages (WSDL, XSD, BPEL, etc.) often produced by code-generation tools. It becomes difficult for a human to discover and understand the dependencies between these artifacts in an existing system. In this paper, we describe ongoing research on using search techniques to facilitate SOA maintenance by allowing users to query collections of artifacts making up a SOA composite application. The main focus in this paper is a case study using our prototype search tool SOAMiner to identify a set of abstractions that extract useful and critical information for maintainers, thereby bridging the heterogeneity of SOA artifacts while opportunistically exploiting their structure. Results of the study indicate that the highest priority abstractions for SOA are datatype summaries, service invocation (calling) relationships, and data usage relationships. © 2011 IEEE.",10.1109/WSE.2011.6081819,,scopus

2007,Framework for understanding and shaping systems of systems: The case of industry and infrastructure development in seaport regions,"A framework has been developed that enables actors to understand and shape industry-infrastructure system-of-systems in seaport regions. The framework connects knowledge engineering with the simulation of system-of-systems evolution. It consists of a system decomposition method using ontologies, a modular agent based model and a knowledge feedback process. The framework was developed and used in a study on fostering biobased cluster evolution in the Eemsdelta, the Netherlands. To support regional development authorities who must balance the interest of each company and the system-of-systems network metrics were developed and incorporated in the simulation. Use of the framework creates a socially accepted model for systems-of-systems analysis that can directly be converted into live simulations to visualize possible directions of its evolution, which results can be used to feedback to the knowledge process. ©2007 IEEE.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2007.4304238,,scopus
2008,The electronic geophysical year (EGY) and the world data center system,"The WDC system was created to archive and distribute data collected from the observational programs of the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year. Originally established in the United States, Europe, Russia, and Japan, the WDC system has since expanded to other countries and to new scientific disciplines. The WDC system now includes over 51 Centers in 12 countries. The WDCs have been very successful over the last 50 years in meeting the needs of ICSU programs. However, in the next 50 years, the WDC system will need to evolve to accommodate the changing needs of ICSU and the global scientific community. Advances in information technology, as promoted by the electronic Geophysical Year, the implementation of new global scientific programs and the rapid increase in global, high-speed network connectivity will require the WDC system to adapt their current infrastructure, reorient their activities and implement new modes of operation. New requirements of existing ICSU programs like the IGBP, the activities of the new international science years (IPY, IHY, eGY, IYPE) and the implementation of the far reaching, long-term, Global Earth Observation System of Systems, will make new demands on the WDCs. The WDC system will respond by placing emphasis on modernizing its capabilities, expanding the WDCs into new disciplines, broadening the System geographically, especially into developing countries, and being more proactive in addressing new requirements from the ICSU and global scientific community.

2008,Earth observation in Canada,"Canada has the second largest landmass on the planet, spanning six time zones and encompassing 20 ecozones. It is surrounded by three oceans with the world's longest coastline. Monitoring and protecting the environment, managing natural resources, asserting sovereignty and ensuring security over such a large, diverse and sparsely populated territory calls for an important contribution from space based Earth Observation systems. Many of the challenges addressed by Earth Observation such as the evolution of the climate and the transport of pollutants are global in nature. This is why, international initiatives, like the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), allow Canada to share data and be more effective in achieving its national Earth Observation goals. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of the Canadian contribution to GEOSS. It provides a technical and programmatic overview of the currently operated, planned and potential Canadian Earth Observation missions and applications, including new mission concepts. Based on this, the authors are offering an analysis of the Canadian contribution to GEOSS and benefits to the international and national interests.",,,scopus
2008,Coupling component systems towards systems of systems,"Systems of systems (SoS) are a hot topic in our ""fully connected global world"". Our aim is not to provide another definition of what SoS are, but rather to focus on the adequacy of reusing standard system architecting techniques within this approach in order to improve performance, fault detection and safety issues in large-scale coupled systems that definitely qualify as SoS, whatever the definition is. A key issue will be to secure the availability of the services provided by the SoS despite the evolution of the various systems composing the SoS. We will also tackle contracting issues and responsibility transfers, as they should be addressed to ensure the expected behavior of the SoS whilst the various independently contracted systems evolve asynchronously. © 2008 by Autran, Auzelle, Cattan, Garnier, Luzeaux, Mayer, Peyrichon, Ruault.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2008.tb00858.x,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2334-5837.2008.tb00858.x,scopus; wiley; googlescholar
2007,Developing distributed solar system infrastructure via system-of-systems methodology,"The purpose of this paper is to introduce the application of a nascent system-of-systems methodology and system-of-systems engineering framework for architecting problems in the national space exploration domain. While the methodology assists in understanding the composition, structure, and interactions within system-of-systems problems, the engineering framework enables us to define the problem, to conceptualize the desired capabilities of the key resources, their organization, and their evolution, and to create computational models for analysis of alternatives. Here the conceptualization, development, and integration of key technologies, systems, and capabilities are supported by exploring their implications on existing and future resources, operations, policies and economics. Ultimately this is intended to allow us to breach the information gaps that exist between the data produced by engineers, scientists, and analysts and the information being exercised by the decisionmakers. Thus, the purpose of employing the system-of-systems thinking is to enable informed decision support for architecting in space exploration architectures; in turn, enabling higher architectural reachability, versatility and sustainability. An example space exploration application problem is presented via the Solar System Mobility Network challenge-an exploration of a possible concept of operations for future infrastructureenabled exploration and exploitation of the space.",,,scopus

2008,Modeling and simulation of net centric system of systems using systems modeling language and Colored Petri-nets: A demonstration using the Global Earth Observation System of Systems,"Understanding the operations of a large ""net-centric system-of-systems"" requires in-depth knowledge of the interfaces and the interactions among the various systems, subsystems, and components. Architectural modeling can help in reducing the complexity involved in designing large networked systems. This paper demonstrates a modeling approach for network centric systems. An example of such a complex system is the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)-a system for monitoring and collecting information related to Earth's resources. The GEOSS is an evolving complex network centric system. The modeling of the GEOSS has been demonstrated using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). In this paper, architecture representation using SysML demonstrates an object-oriented approach of model development. This paper discusses issues related to architecture description, development, presentation, and integration for the chosen domain. This paper also highlights some of the differences between SysML, which is used to model a wide range of systems, and Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is primarily used to model information systems only. Finally, in order to synthesize an executable model from the static views developed using SysML, Colored Petri-nets (CP-nets) have been used. The executable model, constructed using CP nets, is used to validate the architecture against the static model. Overall, this research defines a methodology to model and simulate complex network centric system of systems in order to understand and simulate their behavior using a scenario based approach. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.20095,,scopus; wiley; webofscience

Therefore, the scientific and logical development plans have become an important factor in optimizing the structure of the armament SOS. From the hierarchy of SOS, the concept of SOS structure evolution simulation of the armament SOS was introduced, and the mission and holistic idea of SOS structure evolution simulation were analyzed. Based on the analysis of the main influencing factor of the SOS structure evolution process and the elementary optimizing idea, the optimizing index of the SOS structure evolvement simulation was provided.

2007,System-of-systems simulation for analyzing the evolution of air transportation,"The effective evaluation of future air transportation architectures requires an approach suitable for system-of-systems to produce both tactical and strategic-level decisions in consideration of technological, policy, socio-economic, and multimodal aspects. Towards this goal, the objective of the research reported in this paper was to employ a systemsof-systems-oriented approach to craft a simulation of one of the key networks in air transportation: the capacity network. Principles of network science and multiagent simulation applied in concert form the core of the simulation. While the representations of the individual systems are basic, the higher level approach allows for new ways to optimize at the aggregated network level, determining the best topology (i.e., configuration of nodes and links). The initial results develop a set of high-level behavioral rules and network structure which show promise for satisfying key goals such as delay reduction and reasonable robustness in the system response.",,,scopus
2007,TETRA as a building block to WMNs,"Communications solutions for emergency services are nowadays based on two clear differentiated trends: on one side, the digital Professional/Private Mobile Radio (PMR) technology with trunking facilities and, on the other one, the well known Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) 2. PMR systems, which have been continuously adapted to the users needs from their appearance, are currently fulfilling the most essential requirements from the users. WMNs show also promise for emergency applications because of their suitability for these environments 1. These networks may operate without infrastructure and may be deployed with no previous planning. Besides these two well defined tendencies, there are also other proposed solutions which are based on existing systems or combinations of them. As will be shown later, no solution offers the same level of reliability than that offered by current PMR systems. However, some aspects should be improved. For example, present PMR systems are only able to offer narrowband services (voice and short messaging) and they are based on the already in-place infrastructure. For networks devoted to emergency applications this can result in a serious compromise with cost implications. Most of the time the network is not used (because it is an emergency network) and when necessary, it should be available and provide enough capacity. Emergency networks are not dimensioned for daily operation, they should be able to offer extra capacity to overcome the emergency situation. Predicting their size is an extremely difficult goal. The September 11th tragedy in New York demonstrates the underdimensiong of current emergency communication systems. WMNs can be suitable for emergency cases since they are based on a totally different approach from that of PMR systems. WMNs do not require infrastructure and the reliability and the capacity of the network improves as the number of users increases. Unfortunately, present mesh solutions are based on different technology from that used in PMR. Thus, interworking between both networks is an issue. The possibility to build a mesh network based on TETRA seems a promising option to get the best of both worlds. In this chapter we analyze possible extensions of the TErrestrial Trunked RAdio (TETRA) 3 system with the purpose of building a mesh network 4. The main objective is to provide the services, already offered by PMR systems, everywhere and at any moment, taking then profit of the natural advantages that a mesh network presents. We evaluate extensions which make use of already available functionality of TETRA, such as client, relay and gateway functions, in order to minimize the changes that should be made to the standard and make the adaptation as simple as possible. Although our proposal is focused on TETRA, it also may be modified to other similar PMR digital systems like the Association of Public-safety Communications Officials (APCO 25). Most of the communications solutions for emergency services currently being deployed around the world are based on TETRA or APCO 25. Both are digital narrowband technologies. TETRA, which is today a mature technology, enjoys a wide acceptance around the world. Many countries, not only in Europe (where TETRA was born), are today deploying TETRA networks. Although TETRA covers the user requirements, it needs, as any other promising standard, to go forward as time progresses. The European Telecommunications Standardization Institute (ETSI) is constantly evolving TETRA specifications to better satisfy the emerging user requirements and therefore ensure longevity. TETRA release 2 suite of standards is currently being defined. Some of its main purposes are to extend the current range of coverage, to introduce an enhanced voice codec, and to enhance data services using different technologies while maintaining compatibility with TETRA release 1. The evolution of TETRA towards the release 2 is a future proof investment which maintains the competitiveness with other wireless technologies in the PMR and Public Access Mobile Radio (PAMR) standards field. APCO 25 is the other PMR system in which most public safety systems of the world are based. It is standardized by the Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA) and the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA). APCO 25, similarly to the evolution of TETRA, is going towards an enhanced release in order to support more bandwidth demanding services and applications such as multimedia messaging, high-resolution image transfer, video... TIA 902, 56 which is an overlay technology aimed to offer high data rates, has been developed with this purpose. WMNs are one of the main focuses of the research community, especially in the emergency networks sector. WMNs constitute a promising technology as a solution for public safety and first-responder networks 1. They are usually based on IEEE 802.11 standards, which make use of higher frequencies involving more available bandwidth than those offered by current PMR systems. This radio technology, however, is not more appropriate than that of PMR digital systems. Some of the main reasons are: it presents limitations in front of high users' mobility, it works in an unlicensed ISM band which may be affected by interference and the high frequencies used experiment short distance coverage and low building penetration. The problems due to the use of an ISM band may disappear with the allocation of an emergency band at 4,9 GHz, such as the one done by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) recently, but propagation losses remain as the main problem. Although, in this band, power can be boosted to allow better building penetration, coverage restrictions may appear due to the channel delay spread, especially in the case of outdoor use 7. Another proposal for emergency networks that has been discussed so far is the usage of public commercial networks for emergency communications 8. Nowadays, however, public networks should still improve many aspects in order to reach the reliability that native emergency solutions present. Recognizing the possibility of using public public cellular system for PMR servives, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) presents the first open standard for industry aimed to offer Push To Talk (PTT) over Cellular (PoC). This effort however dos not currently address some of the users' requirements, especially in the emergencies sector, where overlaid solutions may be applied 9. Besides these specific solutions, other approaches consider the usage of more than one technology in one system. The Mobility for Emergency and Safety Applications (MESA) project 10 is an international partnership that was initiated between TIA and ETSI in the 2000. The goal of MESA is to produce technical specifications for digital mobile broadband technology, originally intended for the public safety and disaster response sector. MESA introduces a ""system of systems"" architecture. The SAFECOM program 11, a communication program of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC), supports the project MESA. The Wireless Deployable Network System (WIDENS) 12 project has contributed to the MESA standardization process with a development of an ad-hoc rapidly deployable broadband network demonstrator and system concept for public safety. The goal is to provide high data rate hotspots in order to enhance the public safety, emergency and disaster applications, being complementary and interoperable with existing infrastructures (TETRA and Tetrapol) at the same time 13. Project WIDENS includes a solution called Cross Standard System (CSS) for future public safety and emergency communications 14 which attempts to solve one of the main problems of public safety communications: the interoperability between different communications systems. The CSS is based on the support of several air interfaces in order to make use of different standard communication systems (WLAN, public networks, PMR standards, etc). This is another example where the need of interoperability is highlighted. Another approach which combines different technologies is described in 15. This proposal suggests the integration of TETRA and WLAN. A TETRA terminal may interface with TETRA infrastructure over WLAN access network. It requires the usage of ToW (TETRA over WLAN) dual terminals. The TETRA network, in this case, treats a WLAN area (which can be composed of one or more WLAN sites) as a TETRA base station. The WLAN peculiarities are hidden from the TETRA network by means of a specific gateway. As a matter of conclusion on the topic of alternative systems to PMR, it can be observed that there are other technologies that can complement PMR systems such cellular public systems for improving the number of user or Wireless LAN mesh networks for broadband services, but none of them can replace PMR for emergency services. For group communications using voice PMR, and in our case TETRA, has no competitor. PMR systems account with a variety of users, covering many fields, namely: public safety and public security, transportation, utilities, government, military, PAMR (Public Access Mobile Radio), commercial, etc. Each kind of user has specific requirements. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",10.1007/3-540-71192-9_7,,scopus; springerlink
2008,Determination of the spectral separation between signals and its effect on the GNSS receiver performance. A more pragmatic approach,"The present satellite positioning and navigation technology is clearly evolving towards an aggregate System of Systems. In the near future, a number of GNSS constellations will be orbiting the Earth (i.e. the North American GPS, the Russian GLONASS, the European Galileo or the Chinese BeiDou-2, among the most relevant), and several additional navigation signal components (L1C and L2C in GPS or CDMA signals proposed for GLONASS), will be made available to both civilian and military users to complement currently existing services. Furthermore, the presence of several regional augmentations (the North American WAAS, the European EGNOS and the Japanese MSAS), and the upcoming constitutions of a number of new systems (i.e. the Japanese QZSS or the Indian GAGAN -towards the global coverage, as IRNSS-) will introduce additional complexity to this composite global scheme, making interoperability and compatibility more tedious. For completeness, the consideration of a range of non-navigation related interfering sources in certain radio navigation bands (i.e. UWB emissions, out-of-band radiation from analog/digital television transmitters, DME/TACAN stations or primary/secondary surveillance radar emissions, especially in GPS L5/Galileo E5 bands) adds complication to the analysis. Therefore, in a worst-case future scenario, literally tens of signal components will have to be considered in the interference level evaluation on a given target navigation receiver, making of this an extremely time-consuming task, only possible through hardware and/or software simulations. In this contribution, the dependency of accuracy and computation time of spectral separation coefficients with the numerical methods in use will be studied, a number of results presented, and several practical conclusions drawn from the pertinent simulation cases, making this study as much applicable as possible for the design and implementation of future software simulation tools. Furthermore, a more pragmatic methodology to be followed in order to reduce the runtime of simulations dealing with Doppler-dependent spectral separation coefficients will be proposed.",,,scopus
2007,A methodology for capability-focused technology evaluation of systems-of-systems,"The Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force are in the midst of an acquisition transformation from a threat-based focus to a capability-based approach. A capability is defined by the DoD as ""the ability to achieve an effect to a standard under specified conditions through multiple combinations of means and ways to perform a set of tasks."" While this shift emphasizes design freedom with respect to rapidly evolving and uncertain threats, this design freedom also confounds the quantitative analysis process and increases the complexity of technology forecasting studies and analyses of alternatives. This work proposes a structured process for quantifying the benefit of proposed technologies with respect to one or more top-level capability needs and identifies enabling techniques and methods to facilitate this process. Four key enablers, modeling and simulation, agent-based modeling, surrogate modeling, and probabilistics, are synthesized to create a holistic method that can address the need to identify a portfolio of technology-enabled solutions that provide militarily significant capabilities and are robust to evolving threats. Parametric design capabilities supported by advanced visualization techniques are also highlighted. The developed methodology supports the Air Force Research Laboratory's Capability-Focused Technology Investment and Quantitative Technology Assessment programs. The example problems included in this work are comprised of public domain data and use commercial analysis tools.",,,scopus

In this paper, we argue that viewing enterprises as system-of-systems (SoS) can potentially provide a fresh perspective and unique insights into understanding organizational and operational issues surrounding modern enterprises. We claim that, both as a modeling construct and as a system abstraction, the notion of SoS is well-suited to studying, analyzing and characterizing the structural and behavioral aspects of modern enterprises. Motivated by the potential synergy between these two independent disciplines while recognizing the nascent state of the SoS body of knowledge, we propose a new research direction in applying systems thinking to understanding enterprises and, at the same time, improving the state-of-the-art in enterprise transformation, management, and evolution.",,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-integrated-design-and-process-science/jid11-2-02,scopus; googlescholar
2008,Hierarchical infrastructure for integrated space operations,"A new space infrastructure paradigm that could reduce life cycle costs, deliver exceptional performance and sustain future threats is described. This concept focuses on a truly integrated and transparent system of systems. This approach will permit one management structure to command and control all government space assets. The physical design will assure low vulnerability, fast responses and virtually full-time persistence. This new approach will create a naturally-responsive, intrinsically-protected, space operational environment while meeting the needs of the national defense and intelligence communities. Recent and ongoing transformational, interoperable and joint activities provide valuable lessons learned, but the most cost-effective integrated space operations will be achieved only through a paradigm shift in how space is perceived, managed and operated. The approach described here, if implemented, will require extensive changes among the stakeholder community, a new Congressional approach to funding space programs and significant realignment of organizational structures within several government agencies. Nevertheless, the intention of the new paradigm is to permit the space infrastructure to be cost-effective and inherently survivable while serving all stakeholders in an operationally transparent manner. Instead of forcing advanced technology into a transformational architecture that does not deliver a complete array of products and services in a responsive and reliable manner, it is suggested that funds for space assets be invested such that future systems each progress with the inclusion of evolutionary technologies, systems and software in a manner that steadily moves toward this new space paradigm. In other words, take small steps with each successive investment to ensure that the final objective will be reached. This will require a new and rather complicated approach to space acquisition, requirements generation, funding allocations and development scenarios. A description of this new system of systems and required technologies to make it a reality are offered here. Copyright © 2008 by M. Kaplan and A. Anderson.",,,scopus
2008,Capability Test Methodology's role in system of systems life cycle acquisition,"The Joint Test and Evaluation Methodology (JTEM) joint test & evaluation (JT&E) program is currently developing an enterprise-level Capability Test Methodology (CTM) to deliver high quality joint capability test and evaluation (T&E) across the acquisition life cycle. This Department of Defense (DOD) enterprise initiative is addressing the problem that processes for system of systems (SoS) tests in the joint mission environment (JME) are not well defined or integrated across defense acquisition system phases. Current DOD acquisition policy has a basis in the systems engineering ""Vee"" process model, which portrays phased verification testing at component, subsystem, and full system operational levels. This is reflected in the current Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) structure, which has separate sections and phasing for developmental and operational T&E. In order to help address this problem, we propose a Capability ""Star"" model, based on JTEM's evolving Capability Evaluation Metamodel (CEM) to enhance the ""Vee"" model. The Star model incorporates capability, SoS, analytical baseline, capability gap, and evaluation measure concepts to provide better consistency in assessing SoS contributions to joint mission effectiveness (JMe) needs of the warfighter. To provide better integration between T&E phases, the Star model introduces the concept of critical joint issues (CJIs), which link assessments of SoS attributes, operational task performance, and mission desired effects. CJIs provide enhanced systems engineering verification traceability through SoS life cycle development. Star model processess include upfront development of an integrated acquisition evaluation strategy, cyclical CJI assessments through various test events, and synthesis of performance results supporting joint missions. The Capability Star model and underlying CEM structure provide a systems engineering assessment methodology which can enhance capabilities-driven acquisition practice, currently based on Vee, spiral, and evolutionary approaches.",,,scopus
2008,Decision support: A regional-scale drought monitoring tool for the Carolinas,"The drought monitoring tool was developed for the Carolinas in response to specific challenges, including an intense 4-vear drought and negotiation of new dam operation licenses. It evolved from discussions between researchers, state-level resource agencies, and stakeholders about drought information needs and strategies for managing water in times of scarcity. The tool's resulting array of drought indices and its flexibility with respect to spatial and temporal aggregation reflect the diverse requirements of regional decision makers. Similarly, consideration of decision makers' needs should influence NOAA and other federal agencies planning a National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). This comprehensive early warning system and proactive model for anticipating and reducing drought impacts will require coordinate activities at both national and regional levels. Nationally, agencies must work together to improve observations required for drought monitoring, modeling of the climate system, prediction, research, and data delivery. Clearly, NIDIS must be integrated with other national or international-scale observation efforts such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems. Efforts should also be made to inventory regional resources and to encourage development of new monitoring tools at a subnational level where the social and economic impacts are sharply expressed and where mitigation and adaptation policies intersect. Stakeholders should, guide the scope and design of such tools so that they address decision makers' most salient challenges. State-level drought response plans provide a foundation and stimulus for the monitoring tools that will be required at a subnational level. Of course, the needs of stakeholders will evolve and so too must their decision-support tools. Even in the case of long-term agreements, such as those involved with FERC relicensing, mechanisms must exist to allow management practices to adapt. In the case of the Catawba-Wateree Basin, a Drought Management Advisory Group has been formed to review, update, and improve the low-inflow protocol during the new license term. The Carolinas drought monitoring tool will be an integral part of that process and, therefore, must mature in ways that address decision makers' future needs. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",10.1175/BAMS-89-1-20,,scopus
2007,Inverse infrastructures: Coordination in self-organizing systems,"The paper argues that a new category of infrastructures is emerging, user-driven, self-organizing and with de-centralized control: Inverse Infrastructures (IIs). IIs are not well-understood. Moreover, they represent a paradigm shift in infrastructure development. Their bottom-up development shows tension with the current socio-institutional framework for infrastructures. Internationally infrastructure laws and policies are based on a top-down and centralized view of infrastructures. Regulation is based on a control paradigm that does not fit the characteristics of inverse infrastructures and has no ways to deal with them. Policy (re)design is needed in the face of inverse infrastructure emergence. The paper analyses how these self-organizing infrastructures emerge and develop by focusing on coordination issues. Coordination is central to self-organization. Two clusters of II cases are analyzed on what triggers coordination and how subsequent coordination takes place (coordination mechanisms). Theoretical concepts are drawn from standardization theory, from studies on Open Source Software communities, and from theories of self-organizing systems (i.e. Complex Adaptive Systems and System-of-Systems theory). The two clusters of II cases are peer-to-peer networks (e.g. Napster, Gnutella and Joost) and wireless networks (Wireless Leiden and FON). The paper concludes that, similar to the behavior of ant colonies, II emergence can be understood as an accumulation of local attempts to optimize a situation. Complex citizen and citizen-company partnerships evolve which compete with existing infrastructure provisions and touch on public values (e.g. privacy, copyright).

2006,Evolutionary methodologies for aseismic decision support,"One of the primary objectives of the overall earthquake engineering research program is to contribute toward the development of disaster-resilient communities. As a result, there is a general need to model, understand and ultimately direct the behavior of a wide variety of complex multi-scale systems. For example, within the context of a critical care facility, these not only include the structural and non-structural systems that shape the physical environment, but also the organizational systems that define the social and economic climate. Clearly, the problem does not end at the scale of a single hospital. By expanding our view, we can recognize that local communities and large corporations need to make decisions affecting the performance of a system of critical care facilities. At the regional level, one can argue that public policy and resource allocation should be based upon the behavior of systems of systems. Additionally, at each level, there is uncertainty, ambiguity and risk, along with a temporal dimension that must be considered. Evolutionary methodologies may be ideally suited to study and to provide guidance for many of these tasks. Here we concentrate on two aspects of the overall problem, namely, aseismic design and retrofit decision support and organizational decision support. In addition, we attempt to create a theoretical and computational framework that may have applicability for complex decision-making in general.",,,scopus

We examine the nature of this interaction during Requirements Development, Design, and Integration and Test. We explore the difficulty of maintaining coordinated interfaces between M&S and the transforming enterprise, and the need to establish probe points that foster the ability of M&S to Pace the evolution of the enterprise. We learn from this examination the need for a higher degree of standards convergence between M&S software and Operational software. We examine the relationship between enterprise transformation and M&S, and the potential for M&S technology to dramatically contribute to the transformational benefits of the enterprise. We further extrapolate from this particular case study and offer some generalizations about the promising trends for application of M&S to other large scale enterprises - especially those with intangible or difficult to quantify parameters, embedded among more easily quantifiable parameters, and those enterprises undergoing transformation. Finally, we propose to examine several additional probe points of the lifecycle of the FCS program in future papers using this same methodology.",,,scopus; scopus
2007,National PNT architecture interim results,"The purpose of the National Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Architecture effort is to help guide future PNT system-of-systems investment and implementation decisions, The objective is to provide more effective and efficient PNT capabilities focused on the 2025 timeframe and an evolutionary path for government-provided PNT systems and services, U.S. Space-Based PNT Policy states that the U. S. must continue to improve and maintain GPS, augmentations to GPS, and back-up capabilities to meet growing national, homeland, and economic security needs. PNT touches almost every aspect of people's lives today. PNT is essential for military and civilian applications ranging from the Department of Defense's (DoD) network centric and precision operations to the transportation and telecommunications sectors, improving efficiency, increasing safety, and being more productive. However, the extent of dependence on systems such as GPS, or possible altemate systems for PNT, is not explicitly understood. Absence of an approved PNT architecture can result in uncoordinated research efforts, lack of clear developmental paths, potentially wasteful procurements and inefficient deployment of PNT resources. For example, possible alternatives or improvements to GPS to avoid single point failures have not always been considered from an enterprise perspective. In January 2006, the National Space-Based PNT Executive Committee directed the National Space-Based PNT Coordination Office to initiate an effort with the National Security Space Office (NSSO) to develop a national PNT architecture. This effort is being conducted in conjunction with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (OASD(NII)) and the U.S. Department of Transportation Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) to represent the military and civil communities respectively. The national PNT architecture effort is evaluating alternative future mixes of global (space and non spacebased) and regional PNT solutions, PNT augmentations, and autonomous PNT capabilities to address priorities identified in the DoD PNT Joint Capabilities Document (JCD) and civil equivalents, The results will support future decisions of bodies such as the DoD PNT and Civil Pos/Nav Executive Committees, as well as the National Space-Based PNT Executive Committee (EXCOM). This paper will describe the data gathering, concept development and analysis and assessment phases of this project that will provide its architecture recommendations in the July 2007 timeframe.",,,scopus
2009,An agent-based dynamic model for analysis of distributed space exploration architectures,"A range of complex challenges, but also potentially unique rewards, underlie the development of exploration architectures that use a distributed, dynamic network of resources across the solar system. From a methodological perspective, the prime challenge is to systematically model the evolution (and quantify comparative performance) of such architectures, under uncertainty, to effectively direct further study of specialized trajectories, spacecraft technologies, concept of operations, and resource allocation. A process model for System-of-Systems Engineering is used to define time-varying performance measures for comparative architecture analysis and identification of distinguishing patterns among interoperating systems. Agent-based modeling serves as the means to create a discrete-time simulation that generates dynamics for the study of architecture evolution. A Solar System Mobility Network proof-of-concept problem is introduced representing a set of longer-term, distributed exploration architectures. Options within this set revolve around deployment of human and robotic exploration and infrastructure assets, their organization, interoperability, and evolution, i.e., a system-of-systems. Agent-based simulations quantify relative payoffs for a fully distributed architecture (which can be significant over the long term), the latency period before they are manifest, and the up-front investment (which can be substantial compared to alternatives). Verification and sensitivity results provide further insight on development paths and indicate that the framework and simulation modeling approach may be useful in architectural design of other space exploration mass, energy, and information exchange settings.",10.1007/BF03321518,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

The key advantage of this approach lies in its flexibility to respond rapidly to meet changing needs and address emerging threats. The complexities of network centric operation entail the fielding of systems quickly for operational trials and to continuously discover capability gaps, so as to evolve systems capabilities over its lifecycle.

The CEV and other supporting spacecrafts have been developed through the methodology of optimal conceptual design based on need analysis and hierarchical function structure generation method.

2008,Software cost estimation for Fractionated Space Systems,"Fractionated Space Systems, as exemplified by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Future Fast, Flexible, Fractionated, Free-Flying Spacecraft united by Information eXchange (DARPA's System F6), represent real challenges to software cost estimation. The concept is a traditional 'monolithic' spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly interconnected spacecraft modules to create a virtual satellite, delivering capability which is at least equivalent to the monolithic spacecraft. Concurrently, they significantly enhance flexibility and system robustness, and reduce risk throughout the mission life and the spacecraft development cycle. Such systems present real challenges to software cost estimation which arise from both the concept of a Directed System of Systems (DSOS) and the reduced risk which is primarily achievable only through the application of an Incremental Commitment Model (ICM). This paper will briefly introduce a next-generation synthesis of the spiral model and other leading process models into the ICM, which is being piloted or considered for adoption in some parts of Department of Defense (DoD). The ICM emphasizes architecting systems (or DSOSs) to encapsulate subsystems (or systems) undergoing the most rapid change; and architecting the incremental development process by having agile systems engineers handling longer-range change traffic to rebaseline the plans for future increments while largely plandriven teams develop and continuously verify and validate (V&V) the current increment, as is usually required for safe or secure software. One approach being followed for estimating the software development cost of the Fractionated Space Craft Systems of Systems (FSSOS) is based on the Constructive Incremental Commitment Cost Model (COINCOMO) model and its tool which currently implements together in one tool the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO II), the Constructive Phased Schedule and Effort Model (COPSEMO) and a Constructive Security Cost Model (COSECMO). COINCOMO has an added super-structure to accommodate multiple suppliers of independent software subsystems and multiple builds (or incremental deliveries). Many software systems components today rely on Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) sub-components and/or reuse of (potentially proprietary) open-source or legacy components which are treated like COTS components rather than reused, modified components, and adapted/reused open-source subcomponents, as well as new code. The COINCOMO model also accommodates them without the name-space explosion that happened in COCOMO II. COINCOMO 2.0 is implemented in a database-centric fashion designed with the ability to save and reuse any of the sets of parameters thus making it much easier to do what-if and evolving estimates.

2007,The impact of the development of universal interfaces and model driven architecture development on attaining plug and play systems,"The US Air Force efforts to develop a Universal Armament Interface is indicative of the need to decouple integration of payloads and subsystems from major, costly, system-wide software updates. These efforts, however, are only initial steps in the quest for payload integration techniques that are analogous to commercial personal computing plug and play concepts. Weapons platforms and aerial and space vehicles will always have added safety and reliability constraints and will be constrained in ways that do not affect personal computing. Universal interfaces, coupled with universally accepted application programming interfaces, developed via a model driven architecture approach and utilizing evolving code generation tools should move even safety critical systems further along the path on the quest for Plug and Play. The model driven architecture approach is an emerging methodology that holds the promise of adding the disciplines and precision to software engineering that have been accepted for decades by most of the other engineering disciplines. The current software engineering approach, while improving substantially through the efforts of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), is still basically an individual craftsman approach with each module of code carefully handcrafted. The software products are, therefore, themselves intellectual property and often only maintainable by the original craftsman. This approach, just as hand wiring every circuit, works well enough in simple systems. More complex systems render this approach cumbersome and often unreliable. Model driven architecture development with automated code generation is the next step in capturing the true intellectual property - the knowledge of technology domain experts - in models which define functionality. The development and integration process then becomes: (1) Construct the system from large, reusable components, (2) Build precise, predictive models, (3) Subject models to rigorous testing prior to implementation, (4) Establish welldefined automated construction processes, and (5) Build the product. Integration can then become a matter of validating the interaction of models during the rigorous testing. Currently we collectively are at the initial stage of such an approach. The standardization of universal interfaces is, in effect, the initial compilation of the intellectual property of our domain expertise. These interfaces are technologically agnostic - defining functionality and not based on specific implementations. This technological agnosticism will effectively provide the basis for Plug and Play within complex systems and systems of systems.",,,scopus
2008,Analyzing and detecting problems in systems of systems,"Many software systems are evolving complex system of systems (SoS) for which intersystem communication is mission-critical. Evidence indicates that transmission failures and performance issues are not uncommon occurrences. In a NASA-supported Software Assurance Research Program (SARP) project, we are researching a new approach to addressing such problems. In this paper, we are presenting an approach for analyzing intersystem communications with the goal to uncover both transmission errors and performance problems. Our approach consists of a visualization and an evaluation component. While the visualization of the observed communication aims to facilitate understanding, the evaluation component automatically checks the conformance of an observed communication (actual) to a desired one (planned). The actual and the planned are represented as sequence diagrams. The evaluation algorithm checks the conformance of the actual to the planned diagram. We have applied our approach to the communication of aerospace systems and were successful in detecting and resolving even subtle and long existing transmission problems.

2008,Models for risk management of systems of systems,"This paper addresses the need for developing a body of prescriptive theory and methodology for modelling Systems of Systems (SoS). This will enable analysts to appropriately model and understand the SoS evolving behaviour due to the continued forced changes imposed on them. To place this need in historical perspective, the evolution of the field of systems engineering/analysis is briefly reviewed. The complexity of SoS is characterised by the highly interconnected and interdependent physical and economic infrastructure sectors of every country in the world, which introduce significant modelling challenges for the systems analysts. Economic, physical, cyber, workforce, organisational, and international intra- and interdependencies are introduced. Particular economic interdependency models (the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) and its derivatives) follow. Hierarchical Holographic Modelling (HHM) for studying the multiple dimensions of risk to SoS is introduced, followed by the Phantom System Models (PSM) for modelling emergent large-scale SoS.

2007,Metrics for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) systems: What developers should know,"Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) provide the first widely applicable approach to tying together diverse ""stovepipe"" (or ""silo"") systems. They are, therefore, a ""pure"" example of how to build Systems of Systems (SOS). With the growing interest in and increasing number of implementations of SOAs, there is a pressing need for measures and metrics that can help SOA developers (Chief Architects or Program Managers) in predicting potential problems in the development/evolution of their SOA system. For SOA-based systems, such assistance is vital since their success depends on melding appropriate technologies and design with organizational characteristics, customer profiles, and functions provided, a Systems of Systems (SOS) concern. This paper discusses an ongoing effort in this area. In addition to providing a useful tool, this effort is technically significant for three key reasons. First, SOA specification and assessment requires consideration of technology factors and their relationships to the organization, and to individual information consumers. Essentially, these are related to metrics for systems engineering. Second, requirements (e.g., ease of use, flexibility) are defined in terms of system characteristics that can be modeled and measured. Thus, the system is defined by a set of evolving models and metrics that allow continual evaluation of progress towards eliminating problems. Third, since requirements are initially expressed with coarse-grained conceptual models, measurement of the characteristics of these models can indicate areas where the system might not meet some requirement, thereby allowing early corrective action. Thereafter, more refined models, can be developed to track the success of corrective actions. This paper provides a background on SOA, challenges for SOA metrics, and proposes a model-based metrics framework for evaluating SOAbased systems on an ongoing basis. It provides exemplar metrics and measures for SOA, and discusses several approaches to metrics quantification and presentation.",,,scopus

Specifically, the Solar System Mobility Network operational concept represents a distributed set of capabilities involving human and robotic transportation and infrastructure assets, their organization, interoperability and evolution; i.e., a system-of-systems. Results from architectural trade studies performed show how system-of-systems simulation and analysis can provide novel decision support for architecting in space exploration.

2009,Exploring the synergy between industrial ecology and system of systems to understand complexity a case study in air transportation,"Two objectives are pursued in this article. First, from a methodological perspective, we explore the relationships among the constructs of complex adaptive systems, systems of systems, and industrial ecology. Through examination of central traits of each, we find that industrial ecology and system of systems present complementary frameworks for posing systemic problems in the context of sociotechnical applications. Furthermore, we contend that complexity science (the basis for the study of complex adaptive systems) provides a natural and necessary foundation and set of tools to analyze mechanisms such as evolution, emergence, and regulation in these applications. The second objective of the article is to illustrate the use of two tools from complexity sciences to address a network transition problem in air transportation framed from the system-of-systems viewpoint and shaped by an industrial ecology perspective. A stochastic simulation consisting of network theory analysis combined with agent-based modeling to study the evolution of an air transport network is presented. Patterns in agent behavior that lead to preferred outcomes across two scenarios are observed, and the implications of these results for decision makers are described. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity for future efforts to combine the merits of both system of systems and industrial ecology in tackling the issues of complexity in such large-scale, sociotechnical problems. © 2009 by Yale University.",10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,,scopus

2006,A simulation to analyze aircraft-centric network wireless link performance,"In the past, the government would pay for system design. Later, universities or businesses, with minimal federal funding, would have to fund much of the initial system design, only to end up competing for final system funding. Today, the government cannot afford even that. They require a high fidelity simulation, in a system-of-systems concept, as proof of capability, and only then will a full system design be requested. We created a prototype-simulation system that will eventually tie into real hardware. As part of a team effort to simulate mobile ad-hoc network connectivity, throughput, and latency in large-scale air strike operations, we developed a multi-craft mobility-scenario system. This paper describes the system's capabilities and the methods used to connect the authors' complementary technologies. Additionally this paper will describe how we intend to reach our goal: a mobility and communications scenario-generation interface, coupled with a link simulator that allows the user to test/simulate different ad-hoc connection and bandwidth-allocation strategies against a library of mobility strike scenarios. Towards that goal all three teams cooperated to construct a multi-application system to analyze wireless-link performance in an aircraft-centric network. The system applied newly developed mobility scenario-generation software to create time-stamped mobility and communications data based on high-level scenario descriptions. This mobility/event data was then fed into wireless link simulation software, which calculated link strengths and effectively modeled the wireless network. These link characteristics, and mobility scenarios were furthered delivered to a 3D terrain simulator for quick and accurate presentation of network connectivity in the evolving battlespace. The integration of these disparate software components was accomplished through batch generation of common data files; however, future applications will realize a real-time integration strategy. Ultimately, we believe the integration of these capabilities is necessary for incorporating network communication capabilities in training and planning exercises.",,,scopus

2006,Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) development,"Understanding the Earth's climate and how it responds to climate perturbations relies on knowledge of how atmospheric moisture, clouds, latent heating, and the large-scale circulation vary with changing climate conditions. The physical process that links these key climate elements is precipitation. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission will be key to answering the following related research questions: How are global precipitation, evaporation, and the cycling of water changing? How are variations in local weather, precipitation, and water resources related to global climate variation? How can weather forecast duration and reliability be improved by new space-based observations, data assimilation and modeling? GPM is a joint initiative with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and other international partners that integrates previously planned and dedicated missions in a scalable and evolving constellation of multiple spacecraft and data processing and validation ground systems. Its science objectives are: to improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes; to improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through more accurate measurement of rain rates and latent heating; to provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's precipitation. It is a potential component of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) as envisioned by the intergovernmental Group on Earth Observations (GEO).

2008,Risk in system of systems engineering and management,"Systems engineering concepts are directly applicable to the development and integration of management and technological processes that support all of the major lifecycle functions needed to produce high quality and trustworthy systems in a total quality fashion. Information is the glue that holds together such processes as: research and development, test and evaluation (RDT&E); system acquisition; and planning and marketing. Systems management deals with such issues as program and project management, technical direction of development, and quality and configuration management of the evolving system such as to achieve risk management. Risk issues abound in many contemporary systems management situations. Often, these situations emerge from behavior of many independent agents who attempt to achieve both individual organizational objectives and objectives of the larger organizational unit seeking to attain an interoperable system of systems or system family from the efforts of the individual organizations. A complex system of systems will often exhibit evolutionary, emergent, and adaptive behavior when the individual systems are architected, engineered and integrated to achieve the composite system of systems. Of course, evolutionary, emergent, and adaptive behavior may well exist even when systems are not consciously architected, engineered, and integrated. But this behavior may well be not at all desired. Complex adaptive system behavior manifests itself at the level of both the individual system and the composite system family. These changes are generally experienced as emergent or evolutionary processes. It is for this reason that emergence has been defined as system behavior that evolves from interaction of many participants, and cannot be predicted or even envisioned from knowledge of the isolated behavior of each system or each individual design team. Modeling and simulation are essential in the engineering of large systems of all types, especially those that are subject to evolutionary and path dependent results. Whether we are dealing with human-made systems, human systems, or organizational systems; there is a need to organize and manage for complexity, and associated knowledge and enterprise integration, ultimately for the betterment of all concerned. In this paper, we examine these risk management issues for a system of systems, especially one operating in a federated environment.",10.3934/jimo.2008.4.477,,scopus; webofscience
2008,Managing large distributed data sets for testing in a joint environment,"As the Department of Defense (DOD) matures its testing methodologies for examining the contributions of a particular system or system of systems (SoS) to joint mission effectiveness (JMe) throughout the course of the acquisition process, the test community has begun the process of examining methods and processes for managing large and distributed data sets in a joint environment. Assuming a realistic joint mission data set can be constructed and relevant quantifiable data obtained, we are still left with the analytic question: Can this data repository, operating within this SoS, contribute to one particular, or a set of mission desired effects within a given scenario and specific conditions? This issue becomes even more complex as we examine the fluid environment of modern military operations. More specifically, the Secretary of Defense (SecDef), tasked the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) to determine the actions necessary to create new joint testing capabilities and institutionalize the evaluation of JMe. In response to the Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) tasking, DOT&E's Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap identifies changes to policy, procedures, and test infrastructure to ensure the Services can conduct test and evaluation (T&E) in joint mission environments (JME).

With a heritage of developing and integrating science instruments on space platforms and airborne systems, NGC is conducting analysis of alternatives for a global observing system that integrates data collected from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites with Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) platforms.

2007,Cross cutting structural design for exploration systems,"Cross cutting techniques in structural design is paramount in optimizing mass, volume, power and other key constraints in space exploration related product development. The foundational steps of structural design early in the conceptual phase must include these vigorous cross cutting techniques to achieve a robust system. The schedule pressures associated with the development phase do not present an environment wherein novel ideas, technology insertion, functional efficiencies or architectural changes are readily considered. The structural designer, as the first purveyor of physical definition, must be challenged constantly with more functional requirements by systems engineers. These challenges compel an environment of necessity that in turn drives the product and technology development processes. Our eagerness to proceed with new developments must be tempered with basic fundamental functional analyses, tradeoffs, experience and heavy interdisciplinary dialogue to outline a product strategy inclusive of high priority technologies and evolution. This product strategy will have great influence on top level requirements, cost, schedule and the political realities of government programs. If done properly, the logical clarity of engineering analysis will contribute a more substantial role in decision making with regards to national space policy. Current trends do not bode well for the development of an environment characterized by strict engineering discipline, forward thinking, critical analyses and straightforward requirements driven development. The large dollar contracts, enormous workforce to transform from Shuttle and parochial politics will continue to press for point designs requiring future major modifications; compromises of function, modularity, efficiency and evolvability; and unfortunately bear actual costs way beyond any reasonable estimates. We must proactively show how iterative functional analyses can result in design synthesis capturing all requirements from policy objectives. In this paper we have emphasized the use of existing systems engineering and analytical techniques long espoused by the NASA community for the development of advanced exploration infrastructure. The FAST techniques illustrate how robust design solutions can be generated. The FAST techniques provide a foundational method for implementing and influencing national space exploration strategies including establishing technology priorities. While these techniques do not always result in validation of the various individual opinions of space infrastructure architecture, they fully encompass the tough environmental, operational and mission specific requirements of space exploration. Yes, there is a pathway to exploration and it is defined through a logical process of systems of systems engineering. Absent a general concept for future spacecraft, some of the necessary technologies cannot be initiated and the stepwise path for long duration spaceflight may be delayed while these technologies are developed. Sharing the physical construct of many subsystems in a robust, multifunctional and embedded fashion within the confines of a pressure wall has not been accomplished previously for manned spacecraft. We showed that an architecture based on just that equipment directly interfacing with the astronaut within the ""shirt sleeve"" environment, results in many tactical advantages from a propulsion, power, ECLSS/TCS loading, shielding, volume and safety perspective. Developing these concepts from a cross cutting functional foundation is the key to a sustained path for the manned exploration of space.

Rsd for civil applications may be considered as 'non rival' products since the 'marginal cost' from an additional use is close to zero. Indeed, rsd are a form of scientific knowledge and as such have an important public good trait. Furthermore, since we consider environmental resources as gpg and natural disasters as international public bads, then rsd shouldn't be considered as private goods. We will start examining the base concept of public good and its recent evolution in gpg. To demonstrate that rsd have the potentiality to be considered as gpg has significant implications. Indeed, gpg provide a rationale for international collective action, which is the only way to produce and share them, given that a global governmental authority does not exist. The paper will then recall examples of international initiatives and programs that are based on data sharing principles implying full and open exchange of data and implicitly recognizing that rsd are gpg, such as the Group on Earth Observation, established in 2005 with the objective to put in place the Global Earth Observation System of Systems.

2007,Communicating strategic intent with systemigrams: Application to the network-enabled challenge,"The U.K. Ministry of Defense (MoD) has mandated the development of a network enabled capability (NEC) across all of defense, aimed at producing agile military and nonmilitary effects via a network of networks. This paper provides an overview of NEC, representing it as a complex human activity system of systems (SoS), analysis of which cannot rely on purely traditional reductionist engineering approaches, requiring instead a soft-systems engineering approach. A literature review is then provided, covering nontraditional systems methodologies of the past 25 years, highlighting the more recent trend towards multimethodological practice. The paper introduces the systemic diagram, or systemigram, conceptual model, explaining its evolution from a form of visual language to its use as an appreciative learning system in a soft-systems methodology. Using the written prose of MoD policy makers, a systemigram model is constructed which represents the NEC concept, providing a systemic visualization of its complexity and an elucidation of the key SoS attributes of emergence, hierarchy, and boundary. Finally, the NEC systemigram is used in an example storyboarding technique, demonstrating its utility as a platform for stakeholder dialog leading towards a refined model that reflects a deeper understanding of NEC strategy. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.20079,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2008,A framework for formulating design problems in a system-of-systems context,"The MDO community has been active in developing methodologies to understand and study the problem class known as system-of-systems (SoS). But these methodologies suffer from limitations in key areas such as eliciting the role of connectivity and interactions between the components in influencing the performance of the SoS, the evolutionary behavior of these problems that renders conventional analysis techniques inadequate etc. This paper proposes a conceptual formulation for design problems in the SoS context to understand how stakeholder objectives compete with one another amidst the interdependencies arising out of the interactions and changing problem dynamics owing to evolution and emergent phenomena etc. Some relevant MDO-based formulations are examined and a discussion of how the proposed formulation helps to alleviate their shortcomings is provided. This formulation is expected to serve as a basis to understand and map the different stakeholder objectives, constraints and variables in an SoS, before employing an optimization scheme. An existing lexicon to study SoS problems provided the first step in developing this formulation. Analysis of this formulation and the further work to enhance it are discussed.

2005,Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) progress,"Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) is an international Earth observing ""System of Systems"" that will initiate the measurement of precipitation, a key climate factor, globally. GPM is a joint initiative with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and other international partners. It integrates previously planned and dedicated missions in a scalable and evolving constellation of multiple spacecraft and data processing and validation ground systems. Its science objectives are: To improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes; To improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through more accurate measurement of rain rates and latent heating; and To provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's precipitation. GPM is a potential NASA contribution to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) as envisioned by the intergovernmental ad hoc Group on Earth Observations (GEO) through the U.S. Group on Earth Observations (US GEO). GPM directly supports three of the nine societal benefits identified by the GEO. GPM is envisioned to consist of a core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a calibration standard for the constellation spacecraft, an international constellation of NASA and contributed spacecraft to provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis, calibration/validation sites distributed globally with a broad array of precipitation-measuring instrumentation, and a global precipitation data system to produce and distribute global rain maps and climate research products. GPM is now in formulation phase and recently began the acquisition of the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI), NASA's principal instrument. GPM launches are targeted to begin in 2010.",10.1117/12.627672,,scopus
2006,Thinking about Human Factors Testing and Evaluation (HFTE): Perspectives from a piano bench,"Human Factors Testing and Evaluation (HFTE) is constantly changing as product and system design/development processes evolve, and as acquisition procedures are defined and re-defined. Traditional design criteria and performance outcome measures are insufficient to meet information needs during the design and development of increasingly complex systems and systems of systems. In the world of the performing arts, a highly skilled solo pianist understands how the sounds indicated by musical notation (e.g., pitch, rhythm) contribute to a polished performance. A highly skilled ensemble pianist understands all this, as well as how his/her part contributes to the whole ensemble (e.g., when in a leading role, when in a subordinate role). In an ensemble environment, new performance criteria emerge: Can all participants be heard (balance)? Can everyone begin, change tempo (speed) as necessary, and end together with, or without, a conductor (ensemble)? Five questions derived from experience as a pianist and piano teacher will be used to construct a model for thinking about HFTE. Use of this model will be illustrated.",10.1177/154193120605002403,,scopus
2003,Advancing systems engineering for systems-of-systems challenges,"Engineering activities in future organization development, including various information-based systems, vary, but all result in evolutions of an organization, its capabilities and systems. These evolutions occur in a context of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) where the organization must maintain a sustained, sustainable, and controlled SoS evolution as a whole. This paper presents an understanding of SoS challenges to the application of Systems Engineering (SE) in organizational evolutionary development and discusses the difference between ""developing a SoS"" and ""developing systems in a SoS context"" from an SE management perspective. A new approach to SE process organization and management is presented in order to help an organization cope with the high complexity of SoS evolutions and improve its architecture practice. Philosophically different from many SoS SE studies that consider mainly how to develop a SoS, the new approach is to add a dimension or components of SE practice at the organization level that is aimed at creating a better engineering environment to enable effective applications of traditional SE practice in implementing SoS evolutions. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.10042,,scopus; wiley; wiley
2006,A net-centric system of services model for the Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS) and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS),"This paper considers an evolved technique for significantly enhanced enterprise-level data processing, reprocessing, archival, dissemination, and utilization. There is today a robust working paradigm established with the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS)-NOAA/NWS's information integration and fusion capability. This process model extends vertically, and seamlessly, from environmental sensing through the direct delivery of societal benefit. NWS, via AWIPS, is the primary source of weather forecast and warning information in the nation. AWIPS is the tested and proven ""the nerve center of operations"" at all 122 NWS Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and 13 River Forecast Centers (RFCs). However, additional line organizations whose role in satisfying NOAA's five mission goals (ecosystems, climate, weather & water, commerce & transportation, and mission support) in multiple program areas might be facilitated through utilization of AWIPS-like functionalities, including the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS); Office of Oceanic & Atmospheric Research (OAR); and the National Ocean Service (NOS). In addition to NOAA's mission goals, there are nine diverse, recommended, and important societal benefit areas in the US Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS). This paper shows how the satisfaction of this suite of goals and benefit areas can be optimized by leveraging several key ingredients: (1) the evolution of AWIPS towards a net-centric system of services concept of operations; (2) infusion of technologies and concepts from pathfinder systems; (3) the development of new observing systems targeted at deliberate, and not just serendipitous, societal benefit; and (4) the diverse, nested local, regional, national, and international scales of the different benefits and goal areas, and their interoperability and interplay across the system of systems.",10.1117/12.682888,,scopus; webofscience
2005,"USAF Distributed Mission Operations (DMO): Aerospace Expeditionary Forces training, mission rehearsal and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)","Contemporary military leaders are faced with numerous obstacles to effective training. This paper examines critical aspects of the U.S. Air Force response to these challenges through its user-directed acquisition and development of a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) system of systems. The DMO vision is to provide warfighters routine in-garrison access to multiple, simultaneous, and large/small training or mission rehearsal events within a true joint force environment while avoiding the traditional expense and disruption of having to assemble assigned units and opposing forces for training at a common and observable physical location. This paper details the primary components of the DMO system linking real-time, high fidelity live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) simulators and simulations with the real-world mission planning, command and control (C2) and intelligence systems and products needed when units train the entire mission process (Plan-Brief-Employ-Debrief) and as part of larger Joint Task Force (JTF) training and mission rehearsal events. This paper further examines the key methods being used to implement the DMO vision as the air and space elements of the larger Joint National Training Capabilities (JNTC) network of training systems linking live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) air/space components and entities in a common joint synthetic battle space. The primary objective underpinning DMO is enabling warfighters to train as they would expect to fight, maximizing the combat realism available in modern visually immersive simulators that cannot be replicated in expensive traditional live training. It is being established to meet the full range of Air Force Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) and Home Land Defense (HLD) operational training and mission rehearsal needs from tactical-level individual, team, and inter-team training to participation in operational and strategic-level joint command and control events. DMO system capabilities are evolving to meet both joint and air commander's mandates to train and assess mission essential competencies for JTF and other real-world missions offering distributed AEF units routine opportunities to practice high-end cooperative combat skills, within highly realistic constructive threat/natural environments, with a variety of Air Force, joint and coalition forces. Key findings highlight the need for (1) a professional control force to perform scheduling functions, develop scenarios, and conduct systems-based training; (2) the advantages of user-directed development to evaluate, prioritize, invent and evolve legacy training systems and integration solutions in the field; (3) and the call for industry solutions to improve system efficiencies, tools and common/interoperable data sources.",,,scopus
2000,Man in the loop/hardware in the loop synthetic battlespace simulation,"The ASC Simulation and Analysis Facility (SimAF) and the AFRL Integrated Demonstrations and Applications Laboratory (IDAL) have established a Simulation Based Acquisition partnership to conduct joint synthetic battlespace simulations fo support Joint Strike Fighter EMD. IDAL augments SimAF with the leading-edge simulation capabilities required to evolve next generation ""system of systems"" concepts/technologies where multiple sensors involving both airborne platforms and space assets are utilized to accomplish combat missions. These linked man-in-the-loop/hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation capabilities produce virtual JSF aircrafts that fly virtual combat missions in high fidelity 2010 battlespaces. This strategic linking of spatially separated laboratory facilities reduces research costs, improves technology transition times and enables the collaborative research/technology integration required to develop leading-edge performance for the 21st century JSF fighter. This virtual battlespace testbed can develop, demonstrate and prototype offboard/onboard sensor capabilities that exploit information superiority to evolve revolutionary JSF capabilities. The IDAL/SimAF capability utilizes the Joint Interim Mission Model (JIMM) to generate the JSF synthetic battlespaces which provide a collaborative man-in-the-loop/hardwarein-the-loop development environment.

2005,Obsolescence management for system-of-system: Hierarchies - a technology-based approach,"Many systems face a similar obsolescence issue, which is that the desired system deployment life cycle is much longer than the life cycle of the constituent parts (hardware and software) that make up the physical architecture. Thus, the system baseline must evolve over its operational life cycle just to remain functionally viable. This problem is compounded as the size of the system grows toward network-centric system-of-systems and as the use of commercial technologies and products increases. Thus, the challenge is to perform technology assessments that facilitate the forward planning of technology evolution on the system of interest. A corollary challenge is to perform this planning while simultaneously optimizing the life cycle affordability for the customer. This paper provides a methodology for taking current technology information and transforming it into a system evolution plan (the term system being used in the most general sense to encompass sub-assemblies through system-of-systems) using affordability as the optimizing variable for technology change incorporation. © 2005 by Lockheed Martin Corporation.",,,scopus
2005,Understanding transportation as system-of-systems design problem,"The purposes of this paper are to introduce an emerging class of problems called system-of-systems, present the primary traits of the class, and then described the relevant implications for the aerospace design community. Two primary traits, evolutionary and emergent behavior, are highlighted since they call attention to a network-of-systems, dynamic-behavior focus as opposed to an individual system, static-behavior focus. Further, methodological needs for investigation of these traits lie outside present capability in the community. To explore these implications in depth, the casting of future transportation concepts as a system-of-systems is described. A recently developed ""proto-method"" for this class of problems is presented and explored in the context of the transportation domain, including promising approaches for building effective modeling and simulation. The casting of civil transportation as a system-of-systems problem is important as much of the literature on system-of-systems (limited as it is) resides primarily in the defense systems domain.",,,scopus
2006,Integrated cost / performance assessment of launch vehicle impaction space exploration architectures,"Through our Concept Exploration and Refinement (CE&R) contract from NASA HQ, Schafer Corporation, with guidance and support from the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), developed system concepts for executing a host of future exploration missions. The multiple decades for development and deployment of the System of Systems (SoS) architecture will require the system to be flexible and adaptable to meet evolving mission goals and changing political and economic drivers. Complex and interdependent decisions regarding the configuration of the architecture, selection of technologies and limitations with regards to development costs that may preclude parallel development will need to be made over the course of the SoS development. The complexity and coupled nature of these choices make it difficult to fully understand and evaluate the effects of architecture decisions. The early implementation of integrated cost and performance analyses as part of the architecture design process provides a mechanism for the assessment of design trades and permits developers to more fully understand the near and longer term implications of various architecture development strategies. We integrated cost estimates into our transportation network model of our gateway architecture, to generate quantitative results that were used in the economic evaluation of architecture/transportation alternatives, specifically focusing on the impacts of Launch Vehicle selection. While the Schafer lunar gateway transportation model is different from the NASA ESAS architecture so that quantitative results are not directly applicable to the current Exploration activities, the applicability of this approach in general has been demonstrated. This paper describes the trade analyses that we performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various LV choices on the architecture elements and the operations. The sensitivities of the architecture model to variations in LV payload and estimated development costs were analyzed. The results presented, indicate that over the long term, LV operating costs dominate the cost of the architecture. Also indicated by our analysis is the need to control the LV development costs required to field a larger LV, because the development costs will have a significant impact the annual Space Exploration budget.

2006,An agent-based modeling approach for transportation network systems,"This paper presents the ground work necessary to study the evolving air transportation industry. A survey of related models based on a system-of-systems perspective results in a methodology formulated to address overlooked areas such as market coordination and competition. An agent-based modeling approach underpins the integration of the demand-side (consumers) and supply-side (service providers) entities to effectively capture the dynamic interactions between these stakeholders within the National Transportation System. Machine Learning techniques are adopted to model the competitive sentience of air service providers in making decisions that affect consumers' travel demand over time and vice versa. An interim model is developed employing this methodology on a four-node, inter-city transportation network, and has shown promising results toward further development efforts.",,,scopus
2006,Some future trends and implications for systems and software engineering processes,"In response to the increasing criticality of software within systems and the increasing demands being put onto 21st century systems, systems and software engineering processes will evolve significantly over the next two decades. This paper identifies eight relatively surprise-free trends - the increasing interaction of software engineering and systems engineering; increased emphasis on users and end value; increased emphasis on systems and software dependability; increasingly rapid change; increasing global connectivity and need for systems to interoperate; increasingly complex systems of systems; increasing needs for COTS, reuse, and legacy systems and software integration; and computational plenty. It also identifies two ""wild card"" trends: increasing software autonomy and combinations of biology and computing. It then discusses the likely influences of these trends on systems and software engineering processes between now and 2025, and presents an emerging scalable spiral process model for coping with the resulting challenges and opportunities of developing 21st century software-intensive systems and systems of systems. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.20044,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.20044,scopus; wiley; googlescholar
2006,Simultaneous Overpass off Nadir (SOON): A method for unified calibration/validation across IEOS and GEOSS system of systems,"The US operates a diverse, evolving constellation of research and operational environmental satellites, principally in polar and geosynchronous orbits. Our current and enhanced future domestic remote sensing capability is complemented by the significant capabilities of our current and potential future international partners. Satellite data users, such as the JSCSDA, are following roadmaps for the relentlessly increased ingest and assimilation of these data feeds, driven by the desire to fulfill the evolving operational requirements of their respective end-user communities. In this analysis, we define ""success"" through the data customers' ""eyes"": participating in the sufficient and continuously improving satisfaction of their mission responsibilities. To successfully fuse together observations from multiple simultaneous platforms and sensors into a common, self-consistent, operational environment requires that there exist a unified calibration and validation approach. Here, we consider develop a concept for an integrating framework for absolute accuracy; long-term stability; self-consistency among sensors, platforms, techniques, and observing systems; and validation and characterization of performance. Across all systems, this is a non-trivial problem. NOAA alone sustains >80 observing platforms, >800 variables, and >30K observing data collection points. Simultaneous Nadir Overpasses, or SNO's, provide a proven intercomparison technique: simultaneous, collocated, co-angular measurements. Many systems have off-nadir elements, or effects, that must be calibrated. For these systems, the nadir technique constrains the process. We define the term ""SOON,"" for simultaneous overpass off nadir. We present a target architecture and sensitivity analysis for the affordable, sustainable implementation of a global SOON calibration/validation network that can deliver the much-needed comprehensive, common, self-consistent operational picture in near-real time, at an affordable cost.",10.1117/12.682890,,scopus

Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is an example of an evolving complex network centric system.

2004,Tactical force protection,"The need for enhanced tactical force protection capabilities is evidenced from our recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan and occurs wherever U.S. Forces maintain a forward presence in a potentially hostile environment. Levels of force protection proficiency vary widely from combat units whose mission is to close with and destroy the enemy to combat support/combat service support units performing maintenance and logistics functions. We must provide force protection capabilities that are not only good enough to get the job done, but affordable for the entire force. Addressing the force protection challenge requires an investment in research and development to deliver affordable, scalable, modular and sustainable force protection equipment. This can be accomplished through an evolutionary acquisition strategy of capability upgrades in the near, mid and far-terms that leverage the Army's investments in unmanned ground sensors (UGS), unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and surveillance radar and imaging technology. This approach addresses the field's immediate tactical force protection requirements, while working towards full integration with the Future Combat System. Futuristic Tactical Force Protection will consist of a fully integrated system of systems architecture that will include UGVs, UGS and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that are networked with the Future Force.",10.1117/12.553037,,scopus; webofscience
2004,Search for organising principles: understanding in systems biology.,"Due in large measure to the explosive progress in molecular biology, biology has become arguably the most exciting scientific field. The first half of the 21st century is sometimes referred to as the 'era of biology', analogous to the first half of the 20th century, which was considered to be the 'era of physics'. Yet, biology is facing a crisis--or is it an opportunity--reminiscent of the state of biology in pre-double-helix time. The principal challenge facing systems biology is complexity. According to Hood, 'Systems biology defines and analyses the interrelationships of all of the elements in a functioning system in order to understand how the system works.' With 30000+ genes in the human genome the study of all relationships simultaneously becomes a formidably complex problem. Hanahan and Weinberg raised the question as to whether progress will consist of 'adding further layers of complexity to a scientific literature that is already complex almost beyond measure' or whether the progress will lead to a 'science with a conceptual structure and logical coherence that rivals that of chemistry or physics.' At the core of the challenge is the need for a new approach, a shift from reductionism to a holistic perspective. However, more than just a pronouncement of a new approach is needed. We suggest that what is needed is to provide a conceptual framework for systems biology research. We propose that the concept of a complex system, i.e. a system of systems as defined in mathematical general systems theory (MGST), is central to provide such a framework. We further argue that for a deeper understanding in systems biology investigations should go beyond building numerical mathematical or computer models--important as they are. Biological phenomena cannot be predicted with the level of numerical precision as in classical physics. Explanations in terms of how the categories of systems are organised to function in ever changing conditions are more revealing. Non-numerical mathematical tools are appropriate for the task. Such a categorical perspective led us to propose that the core of understanding in systems biology depends on the search for organising principles rather than solely on construction of predictive descriptions (i.e. models) that exactly outline the evolution of systems in space and time. The search for organising principles requires an identification/discovery of new concepts and hypotheses. Some of them, such as coordination motifs for transcriptional regulatory networks and bounded autonomy of levccels in a hierarchy, are outlined in this article. Experimental designs are outlined to help verify the applicability of the interaction balance principle of coordination to transcriptional and posttranscriptional networks.",10.1049/sb:20045010,,scopus

The Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) DRM provides a notional description of deployed operations for the future MMA. It is primarily an engineering/design tool to support systems engineering activities by identifying significant design-driving operational elements and characterizing them to the level of detail necessary to assess design impact.

To this end, the DRM is envisioned as an evolutionary document that can be revised throughout the acquisition process.",,,scopus; webofscience
2003,Proposed system-level multidisciplinary analysis technique based on exergy methods,"It is suggested that it may be time to consider whether we have reached a plateau in terms of the evolutionary nature of flight vehicle design and optimization. For a time, progress was measured in terms of maximum speed, which is a straightforward metric when the next design is evolved from the preceding model. There are times, however, when we need to depart from the evolutionary process and create a breakthrough design. The question to be asked is whether there is any way to define system-level analysis and optimization techniques to facilitate the vehicle design process with a more global measure of effectiveness. This paper presents such a methodology for the design of the complete integrated system of systems. Work that has been done in energy-based methods is briefly reviewed, since energy is an implicit consideration in many aerospace disciplines. In addition, methods such as exergy and thermoeconomics have been applied in the design of ground power stations and they are currently being studied for application to aircraft subsystems. The objective of this paper is to expand exergy methods to the design of a complete flight vehicle by defining mission requirements as an exergy/work problem cascading down to each component in the same framework. This paper also serves to introduce a special section of this journal devoted to the application of exergy methods to all levels of flight vehicle design. Overall, the proposed technique provides a method to facilitate system-level optimization at all levels of the design process.",10.2514/2.3088,,scopus; webofscience

The near-term goal is to provide the best available unmanned ground systems to the warfighter in Iraq and Afghanistan. The overarching long-term goal is to develop a fully-integrated, layered force-protection system of systems for our forward deployed forces that is networked with the future force C4ISR systems architecture. The intent of the FIRRE program is to reduce manpower requirements, enhance force-protection capabilities, and reduce casualties through the use of unmanned systems. FIRRE is sponsored by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisitions, Technology and Logistics (OUSD AT&L), and is managed by the Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS), Fort Belvior, VA.

JBC2S is an evolution of the MRHA that leverages over 10 years of development in unmanned systems command-and-control. It implements the functionality of the MRHA under the dynamically configurable and highly modular architecture of the Multi-Robot Operator Control Unit (MOCU). JBC2S is a network-centric, geospatial command and control system that allows the field commander and above to plan and execute missions utilizing multiple and disparate manned and unmanned assets.

2000,Space applications of the global positioning and timing service (GPtS),"Spaceborne Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is being widely accepted by both the commercial space industry and by NASA as a key enabler for improving space operations. The use of GPS for space missions has resulted in improvements in space vehicle autonomy and reduced design and operations cost. The current GPS constellation includes 24 MEO satellites with spares. These satellites are launched and operated by the US Air Force. GPS users also have access to signals from GPS augmentation systems. The first of these augmentation systems to transition to an operational capability is the FAA's Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Other organizations are actively developing augmentation services to GPS, and also developing follow-on satellite navigation capabilities. These include international variants of the WAAS service, planned for operation over Europe and the Pacific region, and new satellite navigation services, such as the proposed European Galileo satellite navigation constellation. The concept of a Global Positioning and Timing Service (GPtS) proposes a networked approach that provides enhanced global services using an integrated system-of-systems architecture, coupling signals-in-space from different sources. This places challenges in tightly synchronizing different networks of satellite constellations to provide seamless service coverage. GPtS applications for space users of the service include: autonomous orbit operations, accurate positioning and time synchronization, and attitude determination and accurate relative ranging between vehicles for formation flying. In this paper, some of the existing challenges for these applications are discussed and enhancements in GPS users' equipment and in the evolving GPtS architecture are described that could benefit space applications.",,,scopus; webofscience
2005,Lessons learned in the livingstone 2 on earth observing one flight experiment,"The Livingtone 2 (L2) model-based diagnosis software is a reusable diagnostic tool for monitoring complex systems. In 2004, L2 was integrated with the JPL Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment (ASE) and deployed on-board Goddard's Earth Observing One (EO-1) remote sensing satellite, to monitor and diagnose the EO-1 space science instruments and imaging sequence. This paper reports on lessons learned from this flight experiment. The goals for this experiment, including validation of minimum success criteria and of a series of diagnostic scenarios, have all been successfully met. Long-term operations in space are on-going, as a test of the maturity of the system, with L2 performance remaining flawless. L2 has demonstrated the ability to track the state of the system during nominal operations, detect simulated abnormalities in operations and isolate failures to their root cause fault. Specific advances demonstrated include diagnosis of ambiguity groups rather than a single fault candidate; hypothesis revision given new sensor evidence about the state of the system; and the capability to check for faults in a dynamic system without having to wait until the system is quiescent. The major benefits of this advanced health management technology are to increase mission duration and reliability through intelligent fault protection, and robust autonomous operations with reduced dependency on supervisory operations from Earth. The work-load for operators will be reduced by telemetry of processed state-of-health information rather than raw data. The long-term vision is that of making diagnoses available to the onboard planner or executive, allowing autonomy software to re-plan in order to work around known component failures. For a system that is expected to evolve substantially over its lifetime, as for the International Space Station, the model-based approach has definite advantages over rule-based expert systems and limit-checking fault protection systems, as these do not scale well. The model-based approach facilitates reuse of the L2 diagnostic software; only the model of the system to be diagnosed and telemetry monitoring software has to be rebuilt for a new system or expanded for a growing system. The hierarchical -L2 model supports modularity and expandability, and as such is suitable solution for integrated system health management as envisioned for systems-of-systems.

2002,System-of-systems modeling for personal air vehicles,"On-going research is described in this paper concerning the development of a methodology for adaptable system studies of future transportation solutions based upon personal air vehicles. Two challenges in this research are presented. The challenge of deriving requirements for revolutionary transportation concepts is a difficult one, due to the fact that future transportation system infrastructure and market economics are inter-related (and uncertain) parts of the equation. Thus, there is a need for a macroscopic transportation model, and such a task is well suited for the field of techniques known as system dynamics. The determination and visualization of the benefits of proposed personal air vehicle concepts for individuals presents a second challenge. In this paper, the primary benefit metrics that serve as system requirements for personal transportation applications are the Doorstep-to- Destination travel time-savings and net present value of utilizing the new transportation option as compared to a conventional transportation mode. The modeling and determination of these metrics, the synthesis of vehicle characteristics, as well as existing travel statistical data are integrated into the system model to enable visualization of the design space and to guide the design space evolution through sensitivity assessment.

2003,The Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft modeling and simulation environment,"The need to counter and defeat a new generation of asymmetric, agile threats has necessitated a transformation of today's U.S. military forces. The inherent complexity associated with emerging system-of-systems operational strategies introduces many new challenges for the DoD acquisition community. Modeling and simulation (M&S) shows great promise as a tool for meeting these challenges; however, inefficient use of such tools can increase program costs and introduce technical risk. An evolving concept called Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) defines a set of fundamental goals and principles for improving the quality, military worth, and supportability of fielded systems. This article describes the technical implementation of SBA within the Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) Program. A key component of the MMA M&S strategy is an architectural blueprint for implementing an integrated standards-based environment of M&S tools and databases that can be actively shared across government/contractor boundaries. In addition to satisfying program functional requirements, this common toolset provides an invaluable mechanism for facilitating collaboration and cooperation among all program participants across the acquisition life cycle.",,,scopus; webofscience

2005,Business intelligence modeling in launch operations,"The future of business intelligence in space exploration will focus on the intelligent system-of-systems real-time enterprise. In present business intelligence, a number of technologies that are most relevant to space exploration are experiencing the greatest change. Emerging patterns of set of processes rather than organizational units leading to end-to-end automation is becoming a major objective of enterprise information technology. The cost element is a leading factor of future exploration systems. This technology project is to advance an integrated Planning and Management Simulation Model for evaluation of risks, costs, and reliability of launch systems from Earth to Orbit for Space Exploration. The approach builds on research done in the NASA ARC/KSC developed Virtual Test Bed (VTB) to integrate architectural, operations process, and mission simulations for the purpose of evaluating enterprise level strategies to reduce cost, improve systems operability, and reduce mission risks. The objectives are to understand the interdependency of architecture and process on recurring launch cost of operations, provide management a tool for assessing systems safety and dependability versus cost, and leverage lessons learned and empirical models from Shuttle and International Space Station to validate models applied to Exploration. The systems-of-systems concept is built to balance the conflicting objectives of safety, reliability, and process strategy in order to achieve long term sustainability. A planning and analysis test bed is needed for evaluation of enterprise level options and strategies for transit and launch systems as well as surface and orbital systems. This environment can also support agency simulation based acquisition process objectives. The technology development approach is based on the collaborative effort set forth in the VTB's integrating operations, process models, systems and environment models, and cost models as a comprehensive disciplined enterprise analysis environment. Significant emphasis is being placed on adapting root cause from existing Shuttle operations to exploration. Technical challenges include cost model validation, integration of parametric models with discrete event process and systems simulations, and large-scale simulation integration. The enterprise architecture is required for coherent integration of systems models. It will also require a plan for evolution over the life of the program. The proposed technology will produce long-term benefits in support of the NASA objectives for simulation based acquisition, will improve the ability to assess architectural options verses safety/risk for future exploration systems, and will facilitate incorporation of operability as a systems design consideration, reducing overall life cycle cost for future systems.",10.1117/12.604875,,scopus
2005,Object-oriented development for DoDAF system of systems,The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) provides architectural artifact examples for modeling complex system of systems within the information-centric and hardware-centric global battlespace theater. This framework is utilized by all U.S. government agencies and military branches that procure military hardware and plan for tomorrow's strategic evolution in the armed forces. This framework must be adopted by those business organizations who wish to market their products to the U.S. military. The models mandated by the DoDAF do not always align with the software development methods and production processes utilized in the commercial enterprises who position their products for acquisition into the network centric military markets. This is especially true for software industries where object oriented analysis and design methods have become entrenched as an industry standard. This paper analyzes object oriented development of complex systems and compares the artifacts produced through this method with artifacts produced through the structured architecture techniques described by the DoDAF. The comparison provides an evaluation of the commonality and gaps between both ideologies. © 2005 by Stanley P. Stanilka.,10.1002/j.2334-5837.2005.tb00659.x,,scopus; wiley
2001,Target tracking for heterogeneous smart sensor networks,"Distributed sensor networks will play a key role in the network centric warfighting environments of the future. We envision a ubiquitous sensing “fabric”, comprising sensors distributed over the terrain and carried on manned and unmanned, terrestrial and airborne vehicles. As a complex “system of systems”, this fabric will need to adapt and self-organize to perform a variety of higher-level tasks such as surveillance and target acquisition. The topology and availability of the sensors will be constantly changing, as will the needs of users as dictated by evolving missions and operational environments. In this work, focusing on the task of target tracking, we address approaches for locating and organizing sensing and processing resources and present algorithms for suitably fusing the observations obtained from a varied and changing set of sensors. Run-time discovery and access of new sensing resources are obtained through the use of Java Jini, treating sensing resources as “services” and viewing higher-level processes such as tracking as clients. Algorithms for fusing generic sensor observations for target tracking are based on the extended Kalman filter, while detection and track initiation are based on a new likelihood projection technique. We present results from an implementation of these concepts in a real-time sensor testbed and discuss lessons learned. © 2001 SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.",10.1117/12.438326,,scopus; webofscience
1998,Rapid evolution of all your systems - problem or opportunity?,"Engineering practices for land, sea, air and spacecraft have been driven by different forces and priorities. These forces and priorities are now converging and alert leaders recognize that engineering practices must converge, as well. Ideally the engineering profession will seek an intelligent convergence; one that preserves the current practices that are future-sufficient while innovating new practices where necessary. All engineers across these industries have much to learn from one another. However, the degree to which we converge the upstream, systems engineering practices will be the major determinant as to whether all other engineering disciplines will collaborate - or collide. Systems engineering practitioners and managers must respond to two kinds of challenges. Firstly, how to model and specify increasingly encompassing `systems of systems' in a way that proactively orchestrates their conjoint evolution? Secondly, how to manage change - profitably - which amounts to executing the classic ECP>ECN>ECO cycle with ten-fold more ramifications in each change while taking only one-tenth the time for change processing and decision. This paper explores the problem, identifies key, future-sufficient practices and describes the concepts, technologies and behaviors that will enable Change Proficiency.",,,scopus

2006,Applying an open systems approach to develop federations of legacy simulations,"A System of Systems (SoS) Integrator must be able to assess integrated system performance in order to characterize a system being deployed and to determine the impacts of proposed product improvements and additional functionality. In many cases, the representations of the ""as built"" system components are legacy simulations developed by industry and program offices. Integrating such legacy simulations into a single federated, modeling and simulation environment is an attractive solution to developing an end-to-end system simulation. This federated approach allows the system integrator to incorporate many different models in the analysis efforts, across multiple infrastructures, increasing accuracy and consistency while helping to reduce redundancy in development efforts. Unfortunately, many legacy simulations have been developed in an evolutionary manner using different software architectures and languages and have been accredited for specific uses. Many are proprietary and have been developed by international partners. The software modifications necessary for inclusion in a federation are therefore difficult and expensive. This paper will describe and demonstrate open system techniques and architectures for minimizing the software changes needed to federate legacy representations into well-known international industry simulation infrastructures, such as the High Level Architecture (HLA), Boeing-developed runtime frameworks, as well as commercial infrastructures such as MatLab Simulink. The approach utilizes Boeing-developed products that allow HLA models to be Federated Object Model (FOM) independent. It also provides well-defined interfaces that can be provided to other programs during simulation development, resulting in minimal integration effort when the new simulation becomes available. The open systems approach is currently being used by the Boeing Company to develop an end-to-end simulation of the ballistic missile defense system. Copyright © 2006 by The Boeing Company.",,,scopus
1996,Engineering 21st century systems,The process used to engineer systems exists in the complex interrelationship of organization and product and is driven by the prevailing paradigms. The process used to engineer systems during the cold war is the legacy of today. Future systems will be defined on a much broader scale and will be driven by different paradigms. The legacy process can be converted to a viable one by reestablishing a common frame of reference and vision for engineering naval systems. This paper offers a theory that could be used to reconsti-tute the cold war legacy to provide a viable approach to meeting current and future challenges. The bases of this theory are derived from the key attributes of systems and their evolution from World War II through the cold war. The theory is used to make specific recom-mendations that could be used as a framework for engineering 21st Century systems of systems.,10.1111/j.1559-3584.1996.tb01797.x,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2005,NASA plans for exploration of the earth-sun system,"NASA's Science Mission Directorate's Earth-Sun System Division (ESSD) uses the unique vantage point of space to understand and explore Earth and the Sun. The relationship between the Sun and the Earth is at the heart of a complex, dynamic system that researchers do not yet fully understand. The Earth-Sun system is comprised of diverse components that interact in complex ways, requiring unique capabilities for characterizing, understanding, and predicting change. Therefore, researchers need to understand the Sun, the heliosphere, and Earth's atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere as a single connected system. At the center of the solar system is the Sun, a magnetically variable star. This variability has impacts on life and technology that are felt here on Earth and throughout the solar system. NASA is working to understand this planetary system because it is the only star-planet system researchers can investigate in detail. Using NASA's view from space to study the Earth-Sun system, researchers also can better predict critical changes to Earth and its space environment. NASA's ESSD has a critical role in implementing three major national directives: Climate Change Research via Climate Change Science Program Global Earth Observation System of Systems via the U.S. Group on Earth Observations (US GEO) Vision for Space Exploration NASA Earth-Sun system science conducts and sponsors research, collects new observations from space, develops technologies and extends science and technology education to learners of all ages. NASA now has a system of spacecraft with the ability to characterize the current state of the Earth-Sun system. In the years ahead, NASA's fleet will evolve into constellations of smart satellites that can be reconfigured based on the changing needs of science and technology.

2005,An operations based systems engineering approach for large-scale systems,"NASA has not undertaken development of a large human spaceflight system since the design of the Space Shuttle System. While recent events have refocused human space flight with the goal of sending humans to Mars, the effort to synthesize a new human space flight architecture has been ongoing for the past five years. With a beginning as NASA's ""Space Transportation Architecture Study"" (STAS), through the final Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program, the goals of human space flight have been evolving. The fast pace of the program required a system where evolving mission needs and current design detail could be reconciled in real time. Human operations and mission requirements had to be the driving force behind the system design. A systems engineering tool was needed to tie the requirements to the operations, functions, and design. The OSP Systems Engineering team methodology was based on a modified C4ISR ""system of systems"" engineering framework. This framework places equal emphasis on operations, functionality, and technology, in contrast to a more classical systems engineering approach which emphasizes system functions and hardware based on constraints. This was coupled with architectures based on modular functionality rather than point designs. When the customer significantly changed the architecture requirements, the design responded by variations in functional allocation and performance. These changes in the architecture may or may not have impacted the design of hardware elements. However, in most cases, the operations of the architecture did not change. By designing the architecture to be responsive to the operational needs, the hardware elements were robust and were only minimally impacted by changes in requirements. The tool selected to tie this methodology together was a systems engineering database, CORE™ by ViTech Corporation, which allows for definition of system engineering elements by the user. Orbital defined, modified, and enforced a C4ISR systems engineering framework available within the tool. Operational and functional models were developed and tied to architecture requirements. The human operations and functions that an element had to perform were associated within the database. Requirements were derived primarily in consideration of functions and operations and then allocated to hardware and human elements. When customer mission requirements changed, a quick assessment of design impact could be performed. When the allocated functionality of an element changed or its operational use changed, the requirements associated with those aspects moved with the function or operation. Neither a systems engineering methodology nor a tool alone can succeed. The right tool needs to be present to enforce a consistent methodology. This methodology and implementation presented is a novel approach to supporting evolving large-scale architectures with a requirements management system and top level system performance analysis tool. © 2005 IEEE.",10.1109/AERO.2005.1559728,,scopus

By introducing an arbitrary pair of functionals of a pair of flows (measured dynamic flows), a system of systems of dynamic inequalities with a corresponding comparison hybrid dynamic system is outlined. An arbitrary pair of functionals of dynamic flows evolving in two different time scales satisfying a system of systems of hybrid dynamic inequalities is estimated by the corresponding comparison system of systems of impulsive hybrid dynamic equations. Moreover, employing vector Lyapunov/energy functions as functionals of hybrid dynamic flows, several variational comparison results are developed to estimate solution processes of nonlinear nonstationary hybrid dynamic systems in a systematic and coherent manner. The obtained results extend and generalize the existing results in a systematic and unified way. © Dynamic Publishers, Inc.",,,scopus; webofscience

The Overall ATM/CNS Target Architecture (OATA) project is designed to ensure progressive convergence of existing air traffic control systems towards a single system. The EUR8million project is expected to provide a reference ATM/CNS architecture for all new implementations from 2011 onwards. Eurocontrol launched its OATA project in 1999 as part of its ATM2000+ Strategy. It is designed to enable seamless communication with other systems, such as those of the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The project includes the 29 EU member states and 35 ECAC-countries. Europe's current air traffic management system has limited interoperability, due to the lack of a common operational concept or high-level architecture design. The Single European Sky initiative can only be achieved with interoperable systems based on a common operational concept. To meet this requirement, the OATA project defines the high-level logical design of an integrated ATM ""system of systems"" across all ECAC States, towards which the present individual national systems can evolve. © 2005 Jane's Information Group.

2006,Development of a collaborative capability-based tradeoff environment for complex system architectures,"The design of complex systems in the presence of changing requirements, rapidly evolving technologies, and design uncertainty continues to be a challenge. Furthermore, the design of future platforms must take into account the interoperability of a variety of heterogeneous systems and their role in a larger ""system-of-systems."" To date, methodologies to address the complex interactions and optimize the system at the macro-level have lacked a clear direction and structure and have largely been conducted in an ad-hoc fashion. Traditional optimization has centered around individual vehicles with little regard for the impact on the overall system. A key enabler for reduced cost and cycle time is the ability to rapidly analyze technologies and perform trade studies using a capability-based approach. While many entities have expressed a desire to perform capability-based design, the need for a structured discipline exists. This research will examine how collaboration for the design of such systems-of-systems can be enabled through the use of surrogate models and will demonstrate a top-down analysis methodology for the evaluation of systems and technologies with respect to desired capabilities. A technique for inverse design where any variable can be treated as an independent variable is made routine through the structured use of surrogate models and probability theory. For the testbed demonstration, a depoliticized, notional scenario was postulated to develop a testbed environment in which humanitarian aid and supplies must be delivered to forward-deployed troops for dispersal in a host country under fire.",,,scopus
2000,Joint strike fighter modeling and simulation: The continuing evolution,"From the beginning, JSF has applied M&S in the CAIV process to iterate to an affordable set of requirements for the United State's next generation strike fighter. Warfighters from the USAF, Navy, Marine Corps and the UK Royal Navy have been involved from the beginning, initially with constructive models, where the primary interaction was with PowerPoint slides and a few simple graphics programs. Now the warfighters are periodically brought into various simulation facilities to fly in real-time air-to-air and air-to-surface simulation events. As the JSF program progresses to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (HMD) phase, M&S will be a key player in cost, technical, and schedule risk reduction, Test and Evaluation, and continued CONOPS development. The current M&S toolset will also evolve to work with JSF's training environment, either stand alone or as an element of the Distributed Mission Training (DMT) federation. The Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) balances total ownership cost against system performance parameters. Every technology and operational capability must buy its way onto the system. The total ownership cost of a weapon system includes R&D, Acquisition, and Sustainment costs. The JSF Core Model Suite for the Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase includes Thunder, the Joint Interim Mission Model (JIMM), the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM), Brawler, Mosaic, Radguns, and the Enhanced Surface to Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS). This suite of models is managed through a robust Configuration Control Board with established criteria for model and database improvements, which are worked through the respective government model managers. In addition, the databases that feed these models are strictly managed through a Database Pedigree process. Recent M&S activities have focused on virtual, or pilotin-the-loop, simulation events. These events have taken place at Patuxent River NAS, MD, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Williams AFB, AZ, and Edwards AFB, CA. These activities fall into two categories, Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface. The Air-to-Air simulation environment used by JSF is the Man-in-the-Loop Air-to-Air System Performance Evaluation Model (MIL-AASPEM). The Air-to-Surface environment utilized by JSF is much more complicated. The Joint Interim Mission Model (JIMM) is used for the core simulation environment, the generic Pilot Vehicle Interface is called the Fighter Requirements Evaluation Demonstrator (FRED), and several ancillary programs are used for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Forward Looking Infrared (IR), and Out-the-Window (OTW) visual scene generation. These sensors all access a multi-spectral database enabling correlated SAR, IR, and OTW images. All of these M&S tools are continuously evolving to meet the needs of the program. Near term plans call for hardware-in-the-loop and System of Systems (SoS) experiments in preparation for HMD design trades and T&E, while working through training system support issues. Modeling and Simulation holds a key role in the JSF program-it is the only way to adequately design and test the complex subsystems and their interactions in a representative dense threat environment.",,,scopus

2005,A reference framework of netcentric principles for NEC concept development and experimentation,"The starting point for the development of future Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) is a well founded description of the operational environment, net-centric concepts of operations, and netcentric systems. We have started to define a reference framework for NEC concept development to help guide The identification of the basic concepts of NEC operations; The specification of the fundamental functions in a NEC environment; The definition of the basic building blocks of NEC. A description of basic NEC concepts in the reference framework should also help in identifying impacted areas (e.g., R&D, system development, doctrine development) where follow-on work is required. One of these follow-on activities is experimentation with selected NEC concepts. Modeling and Simulation are two corner stones upon which the development of future Networked Enabled Capabilities will heavily rely. We intend to use the NEC concepts, as developed in our reference framework, as a starting point for simulation based experimentation to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and performance of their implementation in terms of virtual systems-of-systems and the associated command & control processes. Through M&S based experimentation, the required capabilities that will enable the Netherlands armed services to take part in future netcentric coalition operations, will be developed in an evolutionary and pragmatic manner.",,,scopus
2006,System-of-systems modeling: The evolution of an approach for true human system integration,"For many years, analysts have recognized the need to accurately represent the human in system simulations because the human is the most variable portion of the system representation (Allender, 2000). It is especially critical, but challenging to represent the multi-tasking capability of humans that has been a limitation in accurate representation of system performance (Deutsch, 1997). Within the military analytical community multitasking human performance representation, particularly as it relates to crew size has become a critical issue in military vehicle design. Motivated by the needs of organizations such as the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), the Future Combat System Lead System Integrator Boeing-SAIC, and the recognition that traditional military simulations such as CASTFOREM and JANUS have limited capability to accurately represent multi-tasking human behavior (Henthorn, Mitchell, & McDowell, 2005), the U.S. Army Research Laboratory decided to take the initiative to improve the credible representation of human behavior in military system performance simulations. This approach has culminated in a system-of-systems modeling approach that can also be applied in the commercial marketplace. This paper describes the evolution of the ARL system-of-systems modeling approach and the development of the capabilities within the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT) tool that enable it to be used to build system-of-systems models.",,,scopus
2004,Quantifiable software architecture for dependable systems of systems,"Software architecture is a critical aspect in the successful development and evolution of dependable systems of systems (DSoS), because it provides artifactual loci around which engineers can reason, construct, and evolve the software design to provide robustness and resilience. Quantifiably architecting DSoS involves establishing a consensus of attributes of dependability (from different stakeholders' perspectives) and translating them into quantifiable constraints. Unfortunately, there are few established approaches for quantifiably architecting such systems with dependability concerns considered at the architectural level. This paper presents a quantifiable architectural approach for evolving hybrid systems into DSoS so that the attributes of dependability can be justifiably translated into constraints and attached to architectural artifacts. Furthermore, it provides a means of quantitatively assessing these characteristics throughout the DSoS development/evolution process. Basically, this approach strengthens system composition in combination with explicit architecting and quantifiable constraints attached to the subsequent artifacts so as to improve the dependability of the intended systems through design inspection via static checking at the architectural level and dynamic monitoring at runtime. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",10.1007/978-3-540-25939-8_11,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

2005,Applying the systems engineering method for the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS),"To enable the transformation of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) military systems acquisition process from a ""platform-based"" point-of-view to a ""capability-based"" one, the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS). JCIDS prescribes a joint forces approach to identify capability gaps against current force capability needs. JCIDS sets the framework for assessing capability redundancies as well as gaps, whereby requirements officers, acquisition sponsors, program managers and systems engineers evaluate alternate approaches toward achieving resolution of capability shortcomings of the overarching system of systems. JCIDS acknowledges that the acquisition of warfare systems is an evolutionary process of integrating capability improvements over a system life-cycle lasting in some cases, twenty years or more.

2006,Testing the test: Distributed testing in support of system of systems integration,"Over the years, Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has developed a mature but constantly evolving distributed M&S capability in support of systems testing. However, new programs, such as Future Combat Systems (FCS) and its Experiment 1.1, have required RTTC to expand beyond support of systems testing and into support of system of systems testing in distributed environments either locally or distant in nature. System of systems testing requires organizations with different areas of expertise to come together to formulate a common test infrastructure. The Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) was chosen to facilitate data sharing across the test network infrastructure. This paper describes how the use of the TENA Middleware and TENA standards can make a test infrastructure ""plug and play"" compatible with other components while greatly reducing the time needed to integrate test components. In order to assess the ability to perform system of systems testing, RTTC deployed several key components in support of the horizontal integration of the test infrastructure. Range-in-a-Box was used to collect and send data onto the test network infrastructure. The RTTC Camera Control was used to provide live video of any instrumented or tracked experiment participant. The SIMDIS Visualization Tool was used to provide real-time situational awareness of the entire experiment, including sensor data and tactical position information. Finally, the Reflect Suite was used to log all TENA data on the test network and 583 playback test runs as-needed. This TENA-enabled integrated test network infrastructure allowed for full situational awareness and real-time remote instrumentation command and control from any point on the test network, including from over 2,000 miles away. In addition to system of systems testing, RTTC has started to investigate the benefits of being more actively engaged in the Integration Phase of the system acquisition process. This will enable RTTC to help system developers troubleshoot and solve integration issues with their systems at a very early stage before the systems enter evaluation.",,,scopus

In addition, there will be a focus on decreasing the cost of Space Operations and identifying critical technologies needed to enable future evolution of our communication and navigation (C&N) systems. The SCAWG is collaborating across Mission Directorates and NASA Centers to develop and recommend the concepts of operation, requirements, candidate architectures, technology insertion, design options, and acquisition and sustainment approaches for affordable, robust support to human and robotic missions. This paper describes the results of the efforts conducted in 2004, plans for 2005, and communication issues facing the system of systems. The top level architecture is divided into Earth, Moon, Mars, and Deep Space components. The Earth Local Network includes the evolved Space Network (SN), Ground Network (GN), Deep Space Network (DSN), and NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN). The Moon architecture includes the Lunar Local Network covering lunar surface intra-site and site-to-site relays as well as the Lunar Trunk relay to Earth. The Mars architecture is comparable. Science missions throughout the rest of the solar system continue to communicate with DSN via dedicated links. A host of candidate technologies currently in development or requiring new investment are being assessed to enhance capabilities and reduce weight, power, and cost of communications systems, subsystems and components.

2005,Extending NASA Earth-sun system research results to serve GEOSS societal benefits,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) share a common vision and mission to serve society through Earth observation systems. Beginning in the early 1960s, research and development programs conducted by NASA included Earth observation spacecraft focused on improving the capacity to monitor the weather; weather is now one of the societal benefit areas identified by the GEO. From the 1980s through 2004, NASA developed and deployed the Earth Observing System to conduct global research using measurements from the Terra, Aqua, and Aura spacecraft. The research results from these and other NASA space-based observatories are pathfinders for next-generation operational systems and are information sources for evolving computer models used to improve predictions of weather, climate, and natural hazards. Improved understanding of climate change and the prediction and preparedness associated with disasters are two additional societal benefit areas of the GEO. One of NASA's goals is to extend benefits of space research to improve scientific understanding of the Earth system and to demonstrate new technologies with the potential to improve future operational systems. NASA focuses on applications of national priority to transition these benefits systematically, enabling and improving integrated system solutions that inform decisions to serve society. Management of energy, coastal and biological ecosystems, agriculture, water, and human health are applications served by integrating NASA research results into solutions that are consistent with GEO societal benefit areas. NASA and the GEO share a common framework architecture to systematically apply Earth observations and predictions to enable decision support for specific applications areas. Over the next 10 years, NASA plans to continue collaborations with its U.S. and international partners to develop and deploy innovative research spacecraft and instruments.

2004,Capability engineering - Transforming defence acquisition in Canada,"Capability engineering, a new methodology with the potential to transform defence planning and acquisition, is described. The impact of capability engineering on existing defence business processes and organizations is being explored in Canada during the course of a four-year Technology Demonstration Project called Collaborative Capability Definition, Engineering and Management (CapDEM). Having completed the first of three experimentation spirals within this project, a high-level capability engineering process model has been defined. The process begins by mapping strategic defence guidance onto defence capabilities, using architectural models that articulate the people, process and materiel requirements of each capability when viewed as a system-of-systems. For a selected capability, metrics are rigorously applied to these models to assess their ability to deliver the military capability outcomes required by a set of predefined tasks and force planning scenarios. By programming the modification of these tasks and planning scenarios over time according to evolving capability objectives, quantifiable capability gaps are identified, that in turn drive the process towards options to close these gaps. The implementation plan for these options constitutes a capability evolution roadmap to support defence-investment decisions. Capability engineering is viewed as an essential enabler to meeting the objective of improved capability management, subsuming the functions of capability generation, sustainment and employment.",10.1117/12.547938,,scopus; webofscience

To accomplish this, it is very important to identify and use an appropriate architectural framework and contemporary work concerning architectural frameworks is discussed. Most contemporary large system issues can not be approached from a monolithic perspective. Rather, we must consider system of systems and federation of systems issues.

2006,A network theory-based approach for modeling a system-of-systems,"A system-of-systems contains a diversity of individual systems networked at different hierarchical levels. The design of connectivity in a system-of-systems is crucial to extend capability of engineering design. However, up to now there has been no measure to evaluate its performance within existing engineering paradigms in a holistic approach and no mathematical model that reveals design implication. Recent developments in network theory establish statistical measures to analyze the network structure and uncover evolutionary dynamics associated with the formation of network topology. It illuminates the development of design method sought in the design of a system-of-systems. In this paper, a mathematical footing from network science was introduced and empirical analysis in U.S. commercial air transportation system-of-systems (ATS) is reported as a test example of a system-of-systems. Using data of 2004 travel year obtained from Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the structure of the capacity network in the ATS is identified in terms of degree distribution as well as the importance of airports through different centrality measures. In addition, a measure combining demand and network structure is proposed to investigate the relationship between scalability and network topology. We conclude that degree distribution is suited as a design tool in preliminary design of network topologies, and centralized networks are more efficient at handling uniformly distributed demand through shortest paths than distributed networks.",10.2514/6.2006-6989,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2006-6989,scopus; googlescholar

2009,Exploring the Synergy Between Industrial Ecology and System of Systems to Understand Complexity,"Summary Two objectives are pursued in this article. First, from a methodological perspective, we explore the relationships among the constructs of complex adaptive systems, systems of systems, and industrial ecology. Through examination of central traits of each, we find that industrial ecology and system of systems present complementary frameworks for posing systemic problems in the context of sociotechnical applications. Furthermore, we contend that complexity science (the basis for the study of complex adaptive systems) provides a natural and necessary foundation and set of tools to analyze mechanisms such as evolution, emergence, and regulation in these applications. The second objective of the article is to illustrate the use of two tools from complexity sciences to address a network transition problem in air transportation framed from the system-of-systems viewpoint and shaped by an industrial ecology perspective. A stochastic simulation consisting of network theory analysis combined with agent-based modeling to study the evolution of an air transport network is presented. Patterns in agent behavior that lead to preferred outcomes across two scenarios are observed, and the implications of these results for decision makers are described. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity for future efforts to combine the merits of both system of systems and industrial ecology in tackling the issues of complexity in such large-scale, sociotechnical problems.",10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,,wiley; webofscience
2000,Seeing Through the Fog—Attaining ‘Full Spectrum Dominance’ with the System-of-Systems Through Operational Engineering,"ABSTRACT Many discussions and articles address the business and military changes supporting implementation of Joint Vision 2010 and its system-of-systems approach. The dynamics of international military operations and commitments, coupled with accelerating information technologies, can lead to confusion and uncertainty. Customary rules recommend caution, even stopping, when confusion and uncertainty are present, yet the needed changes counsel toward accelerated efforts. Currently, systems engineering does not completely address delivering “operational war fighting capabilities,” or foster commanders' confidence to fully exploit those capabilities upon delivery. Acquisition reform supports accelerating delivery of systems. Likewise, accelerated delivery of “war fighting capabilities” within any opponents' fielding and deployment cycle is imperative. Technical advances in modeling and simulation, utilization concepts, and innovative evaluation methods create an opportunity to facilitate redevelopment of doctrine, operations, and training prior to producing hardware systems. On-line simulation and evaluation tools can overcome the need for physical systems. Specifically, this paper lays out the opportunity to evolve systems engineering to another level, operational engineering, which leverages from the modeling and simulation environment, prior to hardware production. That modeling and simulation paired with coevolution of procedures and on-line analysis will produce a trained customer base, fully prepared for deliveries of “operational war fighting capabilities”.",10.1111/j.1559-3584.2000.tb03322.x,,wiley
2022,Software Development Life Cycle,"Summary The systems and software that make up a system-of-systems are developed by different organizations, using different development cycles. There are various software development cycles, called Software Development Life Cycle. Some systems-of-systems lend themselves very well to sequential developments, such as the construction of a bridge or a tunnel: as long as the work is not finished, the service is unusable. Sequential cycles are composed of waterfall cycle and V-cycle. Incremental development principle is to split the development into several deliveries, each delivery representing a major evolution compared to the previous version, the addition of new functionalities. Agile development cycles are iterative and incremental cycles, the objective of which is to pragmatically and incrementally develop a system. The acquisition of system-of-systems subsystems and equipment must also consider the test environments that will qualify the system-of-systems, whether during the initial design or during future developments.",10.1002/9781394188451.ch2,,wiley
2022,Reporting,"Summary Reporting provides information on the current state of the project against a desired state defined during test planning, to make informed decisions about the project. The quality of a component, product or system can be measured by comparing the requirements that are covered against the total requirements defined. One way to measure the cost of defects is to estimate the impacts of anomalies on customers and users. In a system-of-systems, the impact of an anomaly can be disproportionate to the cost of correcting this anomaly. Reporting of tests and test results will vary in frequency depending on progress. The progress of testing can be measured in various ways, according to different views: percentage of requirements covered, percentage of risk coverage, percentage of coverage of component, percentage of test case coverage, and percentage of resource utilization. During the execution of test campaigns, it is important to measure the evolution of anomalies, their detection and their correction.",10.1002/9781394188451.ch8,,wiley
2007,Assessing hybrid incremental processes for SISOS development,"Abstract New processes are being assessed to address modern challenges for Software-Intensive Systems of Systems (SISOS), such as coping with rapid change while simultaneously assuring high dependability. A hybrid agile and plan-driven process based on the spiral lifecycle has been outlined to address these conflicting challenges with the need to rapidly field incremental capabilities in a value-based framework. A system dynamics model has been developed to assess the incremental hybrid process and support project decision making. It estimates cost and schedule for multiple increments of a hybrid process that uses three specialized teams, and also considers the mission value of software capabilities. It considers changes due to external volatility and feedback from user-driven change requests, and dynamically reestimates and allocates resources in response to the volatility. Deferral policies and team sizes can be experimented with, and it includes trade off functions between cost and the timing of changes within and across increments, length of deferral delays, and others. We illustrate how the model can be used to determine optimal agile team size to handle changes. Both the hybrid process and simulation model are being evolved on a very large scale incremental SISOS project and other potential pilots.

2015,Review of microgrid architectures – a system of systems perspective,"To better cope with the challenges posed by the world today, the transition of systems engineering principles to complex, large scale, integrated and evolutionary system of systems (SoSs) has occurred. On the other hand, distributed generation has made its mark in the power distribution system, as a consequence of economic and environmental considerations. With the exponential advancement of technology, unconventional sources of generation, storage and microturbines have been enhanced. The microgrid has paved its way into distributed generation and looks promising for future prospects. A review of microgrid architectures and models is presented in this study. Various control schemes devised for microgrids are also reviewed. The concept of SoSs is introduced and its applications are discussed. A framework is proposed for microgrids from an SoS perspective and control paradigms based on SoS are explained in terms of microgrid control.",10.1049/iet-rpg.2014.0171,,wiley
2010,Critical Infrastructures at Risk: A European Perspective,"Abstract Infrastructures such as energy, water supply, and telecommunication, are so vital, critical and ubiquitous that their incapacity or destruction would affect the security and the social welfare of any nation. Modern infrastructures cope with new types of emerging risks, due to a variety of threats/hazards such as natural disasters, malicious attacks, technical failures etc. Factors that have transformed the way how infrastructures are designed, developed, operated and de-commissioned relate to liberalization of markets. the interdependency among infrastructures, the increase of cross-border interconnections, changes in ICT, the manifestation of systemic risks. The present paper addresses an European view of critical infrastructures development by adopting risks and vulnerabilities performance within an all hazard approach practical construct. The presentation and the risk assessment landscape are fully articulated within the current legislative framework established by the European Commission and other appropriate legislative bodies. New entities such as European Critical Infrastructures (ECI) are described and documented in view of their protection. A number of principles are highlighted such as subsidiarity, complementary, confidentiality, stakeholder cooperation, proportionality, the advent of the concept of system of systems. A detailed investigation in view of the evolution of risk is made for Critical Electricity Infrastructures. A number of current trends such as the liberalization of the European electricity sector, the internationalization of the electricity system (e.g. interconnection among national grids), evolutionary unsuitability (i.e. current transmission networks are used in ways for which they were not initially designed), and the ubiquity of ICS are highlighted and investigated. The authors argue that i) the amalgamation of electric power systems and ICT produces a new construct, “Electricity plus Information” (E+I), ii) there is a need for risk governance, science and technology in order to cope with new complex situations imposed upon us by the advent of SoS architectures, the involvement of a large variety of stakeholders.",10.1002/9780470087923.hhs228,,wiley
2015,A Complex Adaptive System of Systems Approach to Human–Automation Interaction in Smart Grid,"Summary This chapter expresses three cognitive genres: descriptive genre, normative/prescriptive genre, and know-how genre. The descriptive genre introduces and discusses on the following disciplines: the core concepts of complexity, complex adaptive system (CAS) of systems (CASoS), the application domains of human-automation interaction (HAI) and adaptive autonomy (AA), especially in Smart Grid, and two implementation ideas of expert systems and Petri nets. The chapter describes the automation related notions, that is, automation and HAI, followed by the investigation of HAI models' evolution from the perspectives of dimensions and dynamism. The idea of AA is then introduced as a dynamic HAI scheme, followed by the classification of AA implementation methods. Petri nets are introduced as powerful tools for modeling complex systems (CxS). Finally, Petri net realization of the adaptive autonomy expert system (AAES) is presented, followed by a performance evaluation study.",10.1002/9781119036821.ch12,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119036821.ch12,wiley; googlescholar
2012,8.2.1 Enterprise Systems Engineering - Practical Challenges and Emerging Solutions,"Abstract Much attention has been given over the last 10–20 years to the development of mature practices for engineering complex systems, and these are now largely in place in many large organisations and companies, underpinned by professional bodies such as INCOSE and an increasing number of university departments. Moving the practice of systems engineering into wider fields remains problematic, with many false starts - and even backward steps. While much has been written about Enterprise Systems Engineering – and the allied subject of Systems of Systems – making the transition from theory to practice has proved tortuous and complex, requiring attention to re-engineering the organisation as well as the projects it undertakes. This paper draws on the authors' combined experience - gained from working across a range of organisations, both inside and outside defence – and discusses emerging strategies for coping with the challenges of joined-up projects and programmes. The paper finishes in a more speculative vein with some thoughts on how the practice of ESE might evolve.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2012.tb01390.x,,wiley
2012,Agile Collaborative Systems Engineering -Motivation for a Novel Approach to Systems Engineering,"Abstract Well-established systems engineering approaches are becoming more inadequate as today's systems are becoming more complex, more global, more software intensive, more COTS/re-use based and more evolving. The changes in the organization and management of such systems of systems projects make it even more difficult for traditional systems engineering approaches. Increased level of outsourcing, significant amount of subcontractors, more integration than development, reduced project cycles, ecosystem like collaborative developments, software product lines and global development are some of the changes in the project life cycle approaches. In this paper, we gather and synthesize the current literature to highlight the need for an agile systems engineering approach and to characterize its agile properties in order to support our motivation for a novel systems engineering approach for large scale software intensive systems of systems projects.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2012.tb01434.x,,wiley
2013,2.1.1 Steampunk System of Systems Engineering: A case study of successful System of Systems engineering in 19th century Britain,"ABSTRACT This article presents a case study of the Great British railway as it developed from over 300 individual railways, through a complex system of systems (SoS) to its eventual integration into a single railway. This evolution took place from the 1830s to the early 1950s. The case study focusses on the critical period from 1840 to 1860 when the railways collaborated to form a system of systems. The article evaluates the effectiveness of three current SoS frameworks at identifying the factors that enabled the SoS to operate. Much like the artistic and literary genre of Steampunk, this case study is a mixture of familiar SoS concepts and approaches in an unfamiliar Victorian setting",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2013.tb03043.x,,wiley; wiley
2013,Systems of Systems,"Summary The evolution towards a capability rationale of the defense tool orients the acquisition process towards systems of systems. The defense systems are, moreover, increasingly complex, for they integrate a higher number of heterogenous components and life spans which vary greatly. This chapter defines the various concepts which help resolve the previously exposed issues. It details the main steps needed to go from these concepts to their actual implementation. The concept of a value chain provides all the necessary variability to understand the difference with a system, and considers the abstraction in contrast to a simple technical vision. In the end, the architecture's importance lays in its description of the system of systems without all the design details, in its identification of critical interfaces, and in its comprehension of the allocations between functions and components.

It studies the standards relative to the engineering processes, the products and services, data exchanges, as well as the standards relative to the modeling of business processes. The chapter offers a representation, which will underline the purpose of the various standardizing documents, the links between them and their relevance within the context of systems of systems. It highlights the relevance of standardization in such a field, its critical aspect for the interoperability of systems and systems of systems. The chapter offers some rules for the design of a standard reference base of systems of systems, and to keep up-to-date with the evolution of standards in that field. It also offers an approach for the control of general contracting and project management during the implementation of those various standards.

2013,Emergence and Complexity of Systems of Systems,"Summary This chapter demonstrates how a “system of systems” constitutes a concept which is contrasted with the concept of “unitary technological system” within technological systems theory. It places the relevance of the concept of “system of systems” within the scope of the formation, the ontogenesis of this category of technological systems under an alliance's initiative. The chapter shows which type of concrete referents this concept denotes. The chapter discusses the way concrete systems, and in particular technological systems, develop, evolve, and finally become obsolete. Like unitary systems, systems of systems belong in the definition of technological systems. However, systems of systems have several distinguishing characteristics, which are explained in the chapter.

2020,STRUCTURE OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS,"Summary The need for a systems engineer to attain a broad knowledge of the several interacting disciplines involved in the development of a complex system raises the question of how deep that understanding needs to be. This chapter discusses the hierarchy of complex systems. By their nature, complex systems have a hierarchical structure in that they consist of a number of major interacting elements, generally called subsystems. Adaptive systems change behavior in response to their environment. They are dynamic systems able to evolve to continue to achieve their goals, objectives, and requirements. The chapter provides a description of two categories of system building blocks, functional building blocks and physical building blocks, and a recommended set of elements used in defining the components of each. It presents a basic introduction to the engineering of entities that are more complex than single systems: systems of systems, enterprise systems engineering, and family of systems.",10.1002/9781119516699.ch2,,wiley; wiley
2020,SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING,"Summary System of systems (SoS) engineering (SoSE) is a specialty of systems engineering that focuses on combining multiple systems together in order to accomplish an objective that a single system cannot achieve. There are several differences between traditional systems engineering (TSE) and SoS, many of which the TSE focuses on a single system and single managing organization and the SoS have multiple systems and organizations. There are four types of SoS that may be defined: directed, acknowledged, collaborative, and virtual. M.W. Maier's research describes five initial SoS attributes: operational independence of component systems; managerial independence of component systems; geographical distribution; emergent behavior; and evolutionary development. The chapter also discusses some of the challenges to SoSE.",10.1002/9781119516699.ch20,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10429247.2003.11415214,wiley; taylorandfrancis; googlescholar
2019,Entrepreneurship as a Multidisciplinary Project,"Summary This chapter elaborates on a holistic perspective to entrepreneurship, with details on its various components and interrelations. It presents a systemic model for the planning and operation of an entrepreneurship initiative in context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Main features and insights of entrepreneurship as a multidisciplinary project can be naturally integrated into the 4IR. An entrepreneurship is a complex and complicated entity due to the many ingredients involved and to the reciprocity between them, especially in a dynamic environment characterized by uncertainty, threats, and risks. The purpose of the entrepreneurship is to offer a noticeable added value based on innovation. Given the external world conditions, if the entrepreneurship can identify and utilize the opportunity to initiate an activity that is accepted by the market, it can be defined as a multiple disciplinary systemic project. The leadership and management team of the entrepreneurship initiative is running a “system-of-systems” project, requiring an embedded systematic approach.",10.1002/9781119513957.ch20,,wiley
2020,Security Issue Detection and Mitigation Patterns for Product Line Resource Variation,"ABSTRACT Product Line Engineering (PLE) builds upon an Agile Architectural Pattern—with reusable resources, evolving resource variations, and a standardized interconnect and sustainment infrastructure. Commercial PLE systems attract alternative resource suppliers, such as automotive parts. Defense PLE systems typically result from acquirers encouraging Open System Architectures to enable alternative resource suppliers. Alternative resource suppliers are a major resource variation source in product line engineered systems. Product line engineered systems are systems of systems with potential for complex interactions and unintended emergent behaviors. This article focuses on PLE cyber-physical-social system products, the security issues resource variation can introduce, and security patterns for detecting and mitigating these security issues. Resource variations may cause security issues unintentionally, but intentional introduction is also possible by malicious alternative resource suppliers, supply chain interdiction, and insiders. This article assumes malicious intent in resource variation as its security issue base line, as patterns for effective detection and mitigation of malicious variation intent encompass unintentional occurrences.",10.1002/inst.12305,,wiley
2020,Towards an Automated UAF-based Trade Study Process for System of Systems Architecture,"Abstract The major driver for the Model-based systems engineering adoption in industry is the ability for an engineer to develop systems with traceability to requirements, using one integrated architecture model that enables all types of automated analysis, e.g. impact analysis, gap analysis, trade studies, and simulations. Today, complex real-life problems require the application of MBSE practices, where evolving systems communicate independently, both operationally and managerially, to achieve a common goal. This is the level of system of systems. At this level the major concern is an architecture assessment and trade study analysis, which can lead to different criteria and techniques for identification and comparison of alternatives to keep architecture in line with budgets and timelines. Although there are multiple process that provide step-by-step descriptions of trade study analyses, there are none that detail how trade study analyses could be automated in the model-based environment in combination with existing architecture frameworks, languages, and tools. The goal of this research is to propose an automated trade study analysis process for the System of systems architecture developed in the Unified Architecture Framework models. It is a part of the larger research of trade study analysis automation, including modeling guidance, model quality checks, and automation scripts.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2020.00729.x,,wiley
2020,A Capability Engineering Lifecycle Framework Based on Insights from Australian Defence,"Abstract The Australian Department of Defence is actively pursuing initiatives to improve the integration and interoperability of the defence force and this paper reports on research findings produced in support of this effort. The paper opens with a description of the Australian Defence capability development context together with recent initiatives to provide greater military capability for the available budget. Within this context, the problem the researchers set out to address is how best to co-ordinate the ongoing force Integration and Interoperability (I2) activities that evolve and deliver defence capabilities so that these capabilities can be integrated together at short notice and deployed. System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) approaches have been found to be effective for this class of problem and the paper provides a short review of the most promising candidates. The methodology needs analysis that follows concludes that a range of different SoS approaches will be needed to cover the different stages of the capability lifecycle and the paper then proceeds to describe an initial framework that provides a new way of looking at the defence Integrated Capability Realisation (ICR) SoSE challenge across two dimensions. The first dimension is the time horizon of the planned capability increment: from the present to around four years; four to eight years; eight to twelve years; and longer than twelve years. The second dimension covers the types of activities that are traditionally performed to evolve defence forces such as future force planning, program co-ordination and planning, project capability definition, acquisition, and force generation. The paper describes how this framework provides a simple method to identify which SoSE approaches are the most applicable to given ICR subtasks and also proposes an overall approach to self-organise overall Defence ICR efforts",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2020.00761.x,,wiley
2020,Implementing MBSE – An Enterprise Approach to an Enterprise Problem,"Abstract Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is now widely accepted throughout the industry, from commercial to aerospace and defense. However, while we understand and accept the principles of MBSE, successful adoption and implementation is still a challenge within the industry. The migration from document-based systems engineering processes to MBSE requires more than purchasing tools and a one-week course on Systems Modeling Language (SysML). MBSE does not change the practice of Systems Engineering as defined in the INCOSE SE Handbook or ISO/IEEE 15288, but it does affect the way in which systems engineering processes are implemented and supported within and across organizations. Organizations adopting MBSE must address issues such as new skill and competency requirements for systems engineers, model and data management over the lifecycle of the system, and integration with other engineering tools and processes, among others. It is not a tool problem or a modeler problem. It is an enterprise problem and requires an enterprise approach. The approach must be defined and guided by an enterprise architecture, which is broader than just the engineering tools and their interfaces. It includes the enterprise strategic vision, capabilities, operational concepts, organizations, and material solutions required to achieve MBSE adoption, how they relate to one another, and their evolution over time. This paper provides a broad overview of the fundamentals of MBSE adoption and the broader effort of digital engineering transformation, presenting the digital engineering environment as a system-of-systems. It presents the use of enterprise architecture as a roadmap for MBSE adoption within the industry.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2020.00803.x,,wiley
2020,Towards a Unified Approach to System-of-Systems Risk Analysis Based on Systems Theory,"Abstract In systems-of-systems (SoS), trustworthiness is a key concern, which includes operational risks such as safety, security, and privacy. These are particularly challenging to achieve in an SoS, due to the shared responsibility among independent constituent systems. This paper investigates a unified approach based on systems thinking for analyzing risks in SoS. Having a common framework is important, since many risk areas are related and affect each other. The paper also discusses how traditional static risk analysis can be complemented by dynamic techniques that collect data over time to fuel SoS evolution with respect to risk reduction.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2020.00816.x,,wiley

It introduces the role of hardware/software in systems integration. CP Complex SoS are commonly characterized by multiple often conflicting and competing objectives at different time frames for different clients, and under varied conditions. The chapter addresses the understanding, modeling, composition, and management of CP Complex SoS in terms of their interdependencies and interconnectedness (I-I) and as CP Complex SoS. Software-intensive CP Complex SoS are commonly initiated, commissioned, designed, developed, deployed, and ultimately used and maintained by individuals and organizational entities. The chapter focuses on the acquisition vision to demonstrate the efficacious attributes of the hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM) framework for risk identification. It examines the evolutionary process that has taken place in software engineering and in its role in software-intensive systems.",10.1002/9781119173670.ch13,,wiley

It then discusses the properties of SoS: Operational independence of the individual systems; managerial independence of the systems; geographic distribution; emergent behavior; and evolutionary development. Building on these principles, the chapter helps the readers to improve the understanding of Complex SoS by extending the multiperspective modeling schema (through hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM)) into the phantom system models (PSMs). It then discusses risk analysis of Complex SoS and provides a case study to demonstrate the impracticality and ineffectiveness of currently practiced risk analysis to single systems. The key to evaluating the risk to Complex SoS lies in understanding the genesis of characterizing intrinsic interdependencies and interconnectedness (I-I) of systems manifested through shared/common stakeholders, decisions, decision makers, resources, functions, policies, and organizational setups, among many others.",10.1002/9781119173670.ch4,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.21205,wiley; wiley; googlescholar
2018,Guiding Principles for Modeling and Managing Complex Systems of Systems,"Summary This chapter explores ten principles that are intended to guide both quantitative-centered risk analyses and qualitative-centered risk analyses. Complex systems of systems (Complex SoS) are commonly composed of myriad interdependent and interconnected subsystems; each of which can be characterized by a hierarchy of shared or interacting components and each with multiple functions, operations, databases, costs, and stakeholders. The evolution of the field of risk analysis, since the founding of the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) and its journal Risk Analysis, requires continuous reassessment of its prevailing theory, methodology, and practice. Risk assessment, management, and communication is a continuous, never-ending process. It constitutes the ultimate incorporation and deployment of the ten guiding principles within the complex process of risk assessment and management as well as risk communication. The multidisciplinary nature of the field of risk analysis necessarily implies that each discipline has over time developed, adopted, and adapted appropriate theories, methodologies, and practices from other disciplines.",10.1002/9781119173670.ch9,,wiley
2018,A Novel “Resilience Viewpoint” to aid in Engineering Resilience in Systems of Systems (SoS),"Abstract Designing evolutionary systems to meet stakeholder expectations on safety, reliability and overall resilience is of great importance in an age of interconnectivity and high dependency systems. With incidents and disruptions becoming more frequent in recent years, the requirement for systems to demonstrate high levels of resilience given the economic, political and temporal dimensions of complexity, resilience is of great significance today. Systemic resilience is of high importance at the global level. Therefore, the role of the system engineer and architect is becoming more demanding due to the need to consider requirements from a broader range of stakeholders and to implement them into early conceptual designs. The early modeling process of all systems is common ground for most engineering projects, creating an architecture to both understand a system and to design future iterations by applying model-based processes has become the norm. With the concept of systems-of-systems (SoS) becoming common language across multiple engineering domains, model-based systems engineering techniques are evolving hand-in-hand to provide a paradigm to better analyse current and future SoS. The intrinsic characteristics of the constituent systems that make up the SoS make the challenge of designing and maintaining the reliability and resilience of a systems extremely difficult. This paper proposes a novel viewpoint, within an architecture framework (based around DoDAF, MoDAF and UPDM) to aid systems architects explore and design resilient SoS. This is known as the Resilience Viewpoint. Much of the research in the area is focussed on critical infrastructure (CI), looking at telecommunication networks, electric grid, supply networks etc, and little has been done on a generalizable tool for SoS architecture analysis, especially using existing modeling languages. Here, the application of the ‘Resilience Viewpoint’ is demonstrated using a case study from an integrated water supply system of systems, to portray its potential analytical capabilities.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2018.00519.x,,wiley
2018,Systems Interface Management with MBSE: from Theory to Modeling to Reality,"Abstract Systems interoperate using interfaces. They exist between capabilities, organizations, people, systems, people and systems, systems and nature, systems of systems, and so forth. Interfaces are used to support both system to system communication as well as supporting the complete set of enterprise goals. Interfaces are where the most interesting things happen. And where most things go wrong. This paper addresses system interface-management issues and the benefits of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches. An initial focus will be placed on interface information content that needs to be addressed at each level of system decomposition – from external stakeholders to system boundary to eventually, system component-to-component. The focus will then shift to interface management to model-based and functional/logical design practice. It will also cover system interconnection and communications, how they change, operate and evolve over time to implement mission goals and to satisfy stakeholder needs. Finally it will look at physical systems and the connection to PLM/CAD domains.

1968,Possibilities of articulation of information systems into a network,"Abstract The interconnection of systems into a network permits sharing of effort in certain respects so that, from an input—output viewpoint, only 14 types of systems for handling serial literature are possible; it is believed that systems for handling separate literature are identical, nearly identical, or closely equivalent. Each of the 14 system types produces a different combination of outputs for use by its clientele or by other systems. When the variations in combinations of outputs transmitted between pairs of system types are examined, it is concluded that only 13 different modes of such communication—i.e., “modes of articulation”—are possible. Further, the 14 types of systems constitute only six overall groups; all system types within a group interact with each other system type in identical ways. Finally, the 13 modes of articulation can be organized into hierarchies, with the more general modes subsuming the more specific modes—pointing to the possibilities of (1) planned routes for evolutionary development of systems' articulative capabilities and (2) the need for only a very few standard procedures of articulation from which the more specific modes may be excerpted. In short, articulation among information systems for handling serial literature is not technically complex on the “system of systems” level (i.e., determining what is to be done) once the requirements of the clientele of the individual component systems have been determined. The matter of determining how to implement the what, however, may well be technically and sociopolitically difficult, and perhaps even economically impracticable.",10.1002/asi.5090190214,,wiley
2008,7.6.0 How to Engineer the Emergent Behavior of a System of Systems,"Abstract Emergent behaviors exist in biological systems, physical systems and human performance. Little is currently known about constructing an interoperable network of systems and the incorporation of known emergent behaviors. The purpose of this panel is to explore the methods and principles in developing an architecture including the emergent behavior. SoS displays a global complexity that cannot be adequately managed by hierarchical structures and central control; therefore, traditional systems engineering and management approaches are inadequate and insufficient for a SoS. The challenge is how to understand the initiation mechanisms of the emergent behaviors for a particular system architecture model so that the resident beneficial or harmful emergent behaviors can be enhanced or mitigated with selected changes in the current system architectural model. Is model-based the only feasible approach to develop the architecture model with emergent behavior? If this is the answer, what kind of modeling methodology? Should it be solely based on agent-based modeling? or combination of SysMl and agent-based? Is SysML ready to deal with emergent behavior? For a non-modeling consideration, can we plan for the beneficial or harmful emergent properties? How do we overcome development friction that is bound to arise when there are complex, independent, overlapping governances? We may need experiment with “guided” emergence that help produce the desired SoS capabilities and behaviors. The customer requirements for systems-of-systems evolve over time. There may only be system-of-system modeling at the level of the government agency, who actually procures but does not build, and not at the level of contractors who build the next generation of technologies. Even we have methodology to build SoS architecture, whether model-base or non model-base. How do we train systems engineers to understand the emergent behavior to be incorporated in a newly designed SoS?",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2008.tb00850.x,,wiley
2008,10.3.2 Functional Capabilities In Complex Project Engineering,"Abstract Recent performance in the acquisition of large scale defense systems has not met expectations. The acquisition community in the U.S. Department of Defense has been challenged by the department's transition to network-centric warfare, which leverages complex system collaborations to achieve significant new capabilities. Developing systems of systems or systems of services requires evolved system engineering and project management practices, and better integration of both. This paper presents early learning in this regard from one ongoing system-of-systems development program, the Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP). A “functional capability” concept evolved to become a potentially unique definition of a project that has proved useful in a system-of-systems development context. This paper then explains a recommended structured-development approach built on Functional Capabilities that yields artifacts promoting communication, specification, and work phasing. It also compares the approach to the CMMI™ to demonstrate the wide process applicability of Functional Capabilities.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2008.tb00868.x,,wiley
2008,KR25 System of Systems Architecture Evaluation Using Evolutionary Computation,"Abstract Evolutionary computation and evolutionary algorithms represent a developing science and technology that can be effectively applied to the generation and evaluation of system of systems architectures. A general technique used by systems engineering professionals is a binary matrix representation of a system or system of systems. The specific meaning and semantics of the binary relationship depends of the type of representation used. Typical representations are, “N squared”, design structure matrix, dependency structure matrix, and implication matrix. A key feature of these typical representations is their direct relationship to the structure required in an evolutionary computational approach. Evolutionary algorithms can be applied to the evaluation and optimization of these matrix structures. A new evolutionary algorithm has been developed that applies specifically to the generation and evaluation of systems and system of systems. This new evolutionary algorithm incorporates a fuzzy inference system in the calculation of the best fit evaluation. The current industrial and social environment is populated with a vast array of existing and developing systems. Any new system must take this context into account. Evolutionary computation is applied to assist the system architect and engineer in the evaluation of these complex configurations and interface sets. The new evolutionary computing techniques are applied to system of systems architecting tasks using a well defined set of measures of effectiveness (MOE). The systems architecting task is divided into three general areas organized around the roles and responsibilities associated with the system architect, the system customer and the system engineer. The system architect is responsible for the complete system operation and MOE balance, focused on life-cycle cost and risk. The customer is responsible for the mission profile and mission functions. Operational effectiveness and operational suitability areas are the responsibility of the systems engineers. Affordability, risk, operational effectiveness and operational suitability are the four MOE used to evaluate the candidate system of systems architectures.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2008.tb00911.x,,wiley
2009,3.5.0 Can We Engineer the Emergent Behavior of A System-of-Systems?,"Abstract Emergent behaviors exist in biological systems, physical systems and human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). SoS displays a global complexity that cannot be adequately managed by hierarchical structures and central control; therefore, traditional systems engineering and management approaches are necessary but insufficient for a SoS. Little is currently known about constructing an interoperable network of systems and the incorporation of emergent behaviors. The purpose of this panel is to explore the possibilities of developing an architecture model including the emergent behavior. The challenge is how to understand the initiation mechanisms of the emergent behaviors for a particular system architecture model so that the resident beneficial or harmful emergent behaviors can be enhanced or mitigated with selected changes in the model. Is model-based the only feasible approach to develop the architecture model with emergent behavior? If this is the answer, what kind of modeling methodology? Should it be solely based on agent-based modeling or a combination of SysML and agent-based? Is SysML ready to deal with emergent behavior? For a non-modeling consideration, can we plan for the beneficial or harmful emergent properties? How do we overcome development friction that is bound to arise when there are complex, independent, overlapping governances, for example, the customer requirements for a SoS evolve over time, etc.? There may only be SoS modeling at the level of the government agency, which actually procures but does not build, and not at the level of contractors who build the next generation of technologies.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2009.tb00969.x,,wiley

We discuss Agile in the context of Agile methodologies and in the broader context of business agility. We then define architecture, with a focus on what it means to implement an Agile Architecture of the Enterprise. To do this, we must think of the enterprise as a Complex System: a system of systems that exhibits emergent properties, in particular, business agility.",10.1002/9781118557006.ch1,,wiley
2021,From UAF to SysML: Transitioning from System of Systems to Systems Architecture,"Abstract The fourth industrial evolution, Internet of Things, and large-scale machine-to-machine interactions are driving digital transformation in the industry. Model-based Systems engineering (MBSE), as a new paradigm of capturing and analyzing knowledge about the system, is one of the core factors to drive this transformation. MBSE practices are more and more widely applied to system-of-systems (including enterprise and mission) engineering, which becomes a crucial part of the successful digital transformation. The core challenge today is how digital continuity can be maintained by connecting system models to system-of-systems models, especially when multiple parties are involved in their creation and exploration. This paper studies Systems Modeling Language (SysML) as the standard language to model systems, and Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) as the framework and Unified Architecture Framework Profile (UAFP) as the language to model system of systems and proposes an approach for transitioning from one to another in an integrated modeling environment.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2021.00856.x,,wiley
2021,Automated trade study analysis based on dynamic requirements verification in the model-based system engineering,"Abstract In this complex world, where evolving systems communicate independently to achieve a common goal, the ability for an engineer to develop systems with traceability to requirements, using one integrated architecture model that enables all types of automated analysis (e.g., impact analysis, gap analysis, trade study analysis, and simulation) is becoming more and more vital. Today, the core enabler for automated analysis is the application of model-based systems engineering practices. Model-based systems engineering is used to capture system or systems of systems architecture as descriptive and analytical system models, which relate text-based requirements to the architecture and provide an infrastructure to support trade study analysis. One of the core techniques to perform such analysis is requirements verification. This paper proposes an approach for an automated trade study analysis based on dynamic requirements verification in the model-based systems engineering environment, with a goal to support trade of analysis both in the system of systems and systems engineering domains.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2021.00899.x,,wiley

2017,Knowledge Based Decision Model for Architecting and Evolving Complex System-of-Systems,"Abstract Architecting complex System-of-System (SoS) has evinced keen interest recently, specifically towards factoring in the operational and managerial independence of the constituent systems, and the evolutionary and adaptive nature of SoS development. Architectural decisions have a significant bearing on the operational measures of success, referred to as Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), of the SoS. There is inherent uncertainty while making an architectural decision for complex SoS due to the incomplete knowledge on the implications of the decision. The impact on the MOEs of the SoS may be realized only later in the development lifecycle, influencing the performance and the emergent behavior of the SoS. Further, when learning cycles on the architectural decisions are experienced, once the implication of decision is realized, there needs to be means for incorporating the feedback on the decisions taken, and to reflect back on the uncertainty associated with the decisions. This paper proposes a knowledge based decision model for architecting and evolving complex SoS, that takes into account the uncertainty associated with architectural decisions and the learning cycles and feedback loops experienced. It also enables augmenting the architectural knowledge base, both at a constituent system level as well as at the System-of-System level. The proposed model adopts a decision oriented view that enables factoring in uncertainty, learning cycles and feedback loops in architectural decisions. It facilitates exploring the implications of various SoS evolution scenarios on architectural decisions, while analyzing MOEs of the SoS in relation to the MOEs of the constituent systems.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2017.00343.x,,wiley
2017,Case Study: Agile SE Process for Centralized SoS Sustainment at Northrop Grumman,"Abstract In 2015 Northrop Grumman's GCSS-J Systems Engineering group in Mclean, Virginia, supporting the DISA GCSS-J PMO, had been sustaining and evolving a critical information service portal for 12 independent user groups accessing 22 independent systems. This web-based portal is a centralized Systems-of-Systems (SoS) hub, dealing with unpredictable independent-system changes, mitigating immediate-priority security needs, and replacing uncontrollable obsolescence of COTS software elements – all the while deploying new capability in six month increments requested by expectant users. The systems engineering process combines elements of Scrum, and contract waterfall requirements simultaneously on three release instances, one in development, one in accreditation test, and one in deployed use – with a wave-like transition among the three instances every six months. The process had six years of effective employment and evolution, winning praise from GAO and users alike. Most notable is the real-time control model for re-prioritizing work-in-process, the intimate involvement of customer and users in the agile systems engineering process, and the never-ending evolution with all life-cycle stages in simultaneous activity.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2017.00349.x,,wiley
2017,Using MBSE to Evaluate and Protect the Electrical Grid as a System of Systems,"Abstract A System of Systems (SoS) is a large complex system, with varying degrees of operational independence, managerial independence, evolutionary development, geographical distribution and lifecycle independence. Critical Infrastructure such as the electrical grid contains all the aspects of a SoS. Due to the ever-increasing complexity of the grid, a single model encompassing all aspects of the grid would be impossible. Hence, we need to abstract the problem into a SoS set of aspects and examine the system both at the SoS level, as well as the detailed level. This will require the use of standardized systems modeling tools such as the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), and the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) to define the overall goals, strategies, capabilities, interactions, standards, operational and system architecture, system patterns and so forth. This paper will examine the electrical grid as a SoS, define common characteristics, identify issues and vulnerabilities and MBSE strategies for addressing them.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2017.00381.x,,wiley; wiley
2014,3.2.2 Traceable Engineering of Fault-Tolerant SoSs,"Abstract Systems of systems (SoSs) are characterised by a challenging combination of continuous evolution, emergent behaviour and distributed, autonomous and independent constituents. The development of SoSs that can tolerate faults and harmful events is hampered by these and other complexities. Currently there is little in the way of methods or tools to help SoS developers to design fault-tolerant SoSs. In this paper we present a structured approach for capturing requirements for a fault-tolerant SoS and a fault modelling architectural framework (FMAF) that supports disciplined and reusable development of fault-tolerant architectures. We also provide a traceable mapping of the fault-tolerant requirements into SoS architectural designs. Finally we apply our techniques to a real-world SoS case study.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2014.tb03148.x,,wiley

Intelligent agents, cyber-physical systems employing automated and autonomous mechanisms and components, and recent breakthroughs of household robotics require standardized and formalized automated decision making (DM) process design. Employing an integrated systems thinking approach, we propose a model-based approach which integrates decision-support and decision-making mechanisms into system models. Our formal conceptual metamodel streamlines a standard, generic DM process, enabling the coordination and consolidation of local system-based decisions in a loosely coordinated system-of-systems or a complex system of autonomous agents into a coherent, environment-aware global decision. Our framework utilizes Object Process Methodology – OPM – a robust conceptual modeling framework for complex system and process modeling and design.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2014.tb03161.x,,wiley
2019,Architecting exogenous software-intensive systems-of-systems on the internet-of-vehicles with SosADL,"Abstract The pervasiveness of the communication networks increasingly has made possible to interconnect software-intensive systems that were independently developed, operated, managed, and evolved, yielding a new kind of complex system, that is, a system that is itself composed of systems, the so-called System-of-Systems (SoS). Nowadays, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) enables the engineering of software-intensive SoS, which are opportunistically constructed for achieving specified missions in specific operational environments. In particular, in the subset of IoT where “things” are predominantly connected vehicles, the so-called Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV), the challenge is to exogenously coordinate different vehicles for performing together, through emergent behavior, traffic-related missions, especially platooning. In platooning, two or more vehicles are connected together in convoy using wireless connectivity and automated driving support. The corresponding challenge in the architectural design of SoSs on IoV is to conceive concepts and mechanisms for describing how an SoS architecture is able to create, on the fly, and maintain emergent behaviors from elementary connected vehicles, where the actual vehicles are not known at design time. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the principle of supervenience for describing architecture-driven emergent behavior following an exogenous approach. In particular, it describes the concepts and mechanisms underlying SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), based on the novel π-Calculus for SoS, to support the architectural description of self-organizing SoSs, upwardly causing the required SoS emergent behaviors at run time. Especially, it demonstrates how architectural mediators expressed with SosADL in exogenous SoS architectures support vehicle platooning through an excerpt of a real application on the IoV.",10.1002/sys.21521,,wiley
2019,Architecting systems-of-systems and their constituents: A case study applying Industry 4.0 in the construction domain,"Abstract The development of system-of-systems (SoS) requires a continuous interplay between design decisions on the SoS level and those on the level of its constituent systems (CS), which often preexist and need to be adapted as the SoS evolves. This involves not only preparing the CS to participate in a particular SoS, but also designing the CS architecture to make it easily adaptable to a future SoS context. The problem is in part addressed in an emerging SoS framework in the manufacturing domain called Industry 4.0. It focuses on connected and digitalized production with the ambition of increasing flexibility and efficiency. This paper investigates how Industry 4.0 standards can be used in an SoS context to make CS more flexible and adaptive, and evaluates their usefulness outside manufacturing. The study is based on a case from the construction domain, for which a generic SoS architecture is developed. Several extensions and adaptations of Industry 4.0 are suggested, including specifications of ontologies for missions and workflows.",10.1002/sys.21516,,wiley
2022,"Realizing the Value Promise of Digital Engineering: Planning, Implementing, and Evolving the Ecosystem","ABSTRACT Gaining the benefits of Digital Engineering is not only about implementing digital technologies. The Innovation Ecosystem is a system of systems in its own right, at least partly engineered, subject to the risks and challenges of evolving socio-technical systems. This article summarizes an aid to analyzing and understanding, planning, implementation, and ongoing improvement of the Innovation Ecosystem or its components. It is based on a generic ecosystem analysis reference model with particular focal viewpoints. It is represented as a configurable model-based formal pattern and the INCOSE MBSE Patterns Working Group initially applied it in a related INCOSE collaboration project led by the Agile Systems Engineering Working Group. Users of the resulting framework subsequently elaborated and applied aspects in the context of a wide variety of commercial and defense ecosystems across different domains. While connecting to several current and historical contexts, it is particularly revealing of Digital Engineering's special promise. By explicating the recurrent theme of Consistency Management that underlies all historical innovation, it enhances our understanding of historical as well as future engineering and life cycle management. This includes the ecosystem preparation of internal and supply chain human and technical resources to effectively consume and exploit digital information assets, not just create them. The ecosystem model carries its own representation of enhanced capability implementation by generation of agile release train increments, along with evolutionary steering based on feedback and group learning.",10.1002/inst.12372,,wiley
2022,"Systems, Systems of Systems, and Cyber-Physical Systems *","Summary An engineered system is a composition of multiple entities. The existence of an engineered system is justified by purposes. The exposed system characteristics permit stakeholders to achieve these purposes. Systems are situated in their system context and may be evolved. Due to the digital revolution, a term which refers to the changes coming along with digital computing and communication technologies, there is an increased occurrence of Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) instead of pure cyber-physical systems (CPSs) or System of Systems (SoS). SoS and CPS are often denoted as smart systems if they can monitor their environment and adapt their behavior accordingly. Along with the evolution of systems across SoS and/or CPSs toward up-to-date CPSoS, the extent and number of relations between system elements increases. The development of system architectures is an important and fundamental task in Model-based Systems Engineering which can be applied to various types of systems, e.g. SoS, CPS, and CPSoS.",10.1002/9781119746683.ch4,,wiley
2005,5.2.3 Obsolescence Management for System-of-System Hierarchies – A Technology-based Approach,"Abstract Many systems face a similar obsolescence issue, which is that the desired system deployment life cycle is much longer than the life cycle of the constituent parts (hardware and software) that make up the physical architecture. Thus, the system baseline must evolve over its operational life cycle just to remain functionally viable. This problem is compounded as the size of the system grows toward network-centric system-of-systems and as the use of commercial technologies and products increases. Thus, the challenge is to perform technology assessments that facilitate the forward planning of technology evolution on the system of interest. A corollary challenge is to perform this planning while simultaneously optimizing the life cycle affordability for the customer. This paper provides a methodology for taking current technology information and transforming it into a system evolution plan (the term system being used in the most general sense to encompass sub-assemblies through system-of-systems) using affordability as the optimizing variable for technology change incorporation.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2005.tb00705.x,,wiley
2006,3.3.1 Network Centric Operation Implementations in Several Domains,"Abstract A current focus in building military systems is the use of network based approaches. This is exemplified in the concepts of Network Centric Operations (NCO), Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) or Network Based Defense (NBD). These concepts are, in part, inspired and motivated by the network based approaches that have revolutionized conducting business and operations in commercial domains across a wide spectrum of activities. Network centric systems in the commercial domain display a number of interesting capabilities. These included the means to integrate extremely large groups of users into effective systems-of-systems with time constants measured on the order of hours/days. The basic network centric enablers used in these systems fall into several major categories. This paper examines several high level architectures used in network centric operations for a number of non-military network based systems; a ‘bricks and mortar’ retailer, on-line ‘eCommerce’ businesses, and in software development. This examination is done by means of a literature survey and focuses on the interaction patterns that the systems must support, important capabilities the systems provide and important architectural enablers.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2006.tb02754.x,,wiley

2023,Explainable AI and Counterfactuals for Test and Evaluation of Intelligent Engineered Systems,"Abstract Systems Engineering (SE) based test and evaluation (T\&E) approaches have proven crucial for successful realization of most modern-day complex systems and system-of-systems solutions. The design, test, and evaluation of engineered systems with many technologically advanced and complex components hinges on well-structured integration and life cycle evolution process models, clearly defined requirements, along with controllability, observability, and stability (COS) of components that transcend to the system-level. However, integration of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificially intelligent (AI) components invalidates some SE foundations as the DL algorithms are primarily data-driven with opaque decision-making constructs. As a result, the current SE T\&E approaches, although necessary, have become insufficient to evaluate the adoption of ML/DL/AI methods in engineered systems. This paper proposes two new approaches—explainable AI (xAI) and counterfactual testing and evaluation (cT\&E)—as addition to the SE tool set for T\&E of intelligent engineered systems. An example of SE T\&E considerations is provided based on a conceptual aircraft control system implementation comparing as a classical controller and a DL-based reinforcement learning controller.",10.1002/iis2.13096,,wiley
2001,System of Systems (SoS) enterprise systems engineering for information-intensive organizations,"Abstract This article describes the emerging roles of the systems engineering (SE) function in supporting enterprise management in information-intensive organizations. “Enterprise Systems Engineering” (ESE) comprises three major roles or “levels” of systems engineering for successful and efficient development or procurement of large complex systems of systems (SoS). While the authors' experience focuses predominantly on government organizations acting as their own SoS integrators, the SoS ESE concept has generic applicability for any organization, public or private, seeking to attain competitive advantage through leveraging of information technology resources and systems. The processes and tools described here have been developed and successfully employed to facilitate government project management and investment decisions and control. [Carlock and Decker, 1998] This paper describes a formal three-level SoS ESE process that, at the top level, organizes and maintains all of the details of the enterprise-wide SoS architecture and strategic development plan in a flexible framework that accommodates the changes expected over a long SoS evolution. The information maintained in this framework allows the organization to know where it is going, how and when it is going to get there, the required capabilities and interfaces of each SoS component, and the impact of changes to system requirements, budgets, schedules, etc., on the overall SoS. The middle level processes allow the organization to perform trade studies among alternative solutions to implement required capabilities based on what is best for the enterprise-wide SoS rather than just local considerations. The end result of the middle level processes is a selected and approved solution and its associated cost, schedule, benefits, and technical baselines. The third level processes implement the approved solutions in accordance with the approved baselines. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Syst Eng 4: 242–261, 2001",10.1002/sys.1021,,wiley
2016,Systems Engineering Challenges in Simulation Based Aviation Training: A Few Insights,"Abstract Simulation based training means using simulated environment to create training lessons, more focused towards interactive learning by simulating real world scenarios. Simulation based training has been used extensively in the field of aviation for many years. Flight simulator as a product is quite complex and all the lifecycle phases such as requirements, analysis, design, development, integration, verification and validation are not very well interconnected or centralized, which adds to complexity in producing an artefact in a complex system of systems environment. Moreover, the lack of integrated method for ensuring the traceability of requirements and customization, acquisition of knowledge and data, integration and changes in hardware, and the design and testing of software creates massive challenges for simulation companies developing system of systems products. The current paper provides insights into such challenges that typically exist in the Flight Simulation industry. Methods and techniques inspired from the Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) aspects of Systems Engineering are proposed to evolve existing Systems Engineering practices for more efficient Requirements Management, Interface \& Change propagation management and Hardware and Software integration solutions.

2016,ARCHITECTURAL MODELLING PATTERNS FOR SYSTEMS OF SYSTEMS,"ABSTRACT Architectural properties are amongst the defining features of systems of systems (SoS) – including distribution of the constituent parts, their autonomy, long lifecycles and unsynchronized evolution. In addition, SoS engineers need to consider the integration of legacy constituent parts, reason about the emergent behaviour of the SoS, determine the level of centralised control, and support resilience and fault tolerance. These are all features which can be tackled at least partially through architectural patterns. In this article, we present three example patterns previously identified in SoS. Patterns like these can also be used as a mechanism for transferring lessons learned in one SoS application domain into another domain. For each pattern presented, we highlight features that address the challenges posed by SoS. Finally, we detail ongoing efforts with the INCOSE Systems of Systems and Patterns Working Groups to prioritise future work in this area.",10.1002/inst.12112,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2334-5837.2015.00123.x,wiley; googlescholar
2016,ENGINEERING THE VIRTUAL OR COLLABORATIVE SOS,"ABSTRACT The largest, most complex, and most prevalent systems of systems (SoS) are virtual or collaborative in nature. In such a SoS, there is no central authority to perform systems engineering. Yet, the virtual or collaborative SoS does grow, adapt, and evolve in response to the needs of the many stakeholders. Changes in the SoS happen because of many changes in the constituent systems (CS), with each change occurring when the CS owners deem it useful to change. The systems engineering activities in the CS can be used to guide and affect the SoS through a collaborative and competitive environment in which each CS systems engineer seeks to optimize the SoS behavior for their own purposes. This requires a different approach to the systems engineering activities, in which greater emphasis is on the higher-level analysis, architecting, and quantification. This paper describes the modified systems engineering approach, showing how to engineer the SoS from within the scope of a CS.",10.1002/inst.12113,,wiley
2016,A Case Study of a Successful System: The Scottish Lighthouses from the 18th to the 21st Century.,"Abstract In the late 18th century, the period in which Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Kidnapped was set, up to 20\% of the cargo in ships sailing round the Scottish coast was lost to shipwreck. This level of financial loss made the ship owners willing to pay for safety systems to reduce the risk to their investment. There followed an astonishing period of engineering and organisational innovation to deploy a complex socio technical system that has continually delivered value for over two centuries. The 100 or so lighthouses built by the Stevenson family, all of them still standing and most of them still operating, were engineering marvels in their own right. But even more marvellous in many ways was the socio technical system the Stevensons and the Northern Lighthouse Board built to operate the “lighthouse capability”. The paper will show how all components of modern capability management were developed to exploit the technology in an enduring and continuously evolving system-of-systems that made the wild seas off Scotland relatively safe for seafarers. Of particular interest is the long term strategic planning across multiple lines of development: as the light houses were automated, the inevitable workforce reduction was achieved by retirement and redeployment, not by redundancies. This whole story is an excellent example of “through-life capability management” of an “enduring system”. The paper also shows that modern approaches to systems architecting can be generalised – and that all perspectives offered by modern architecting methods are needed – to describe a two-century-old system! The case study also demonstrates the need to describe a system-of-systems at multiple levels, and a method for doing this.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2016.00243.x,,wiley
2016,Making Smart Cities Smarter – MBSE Driven IoT,"Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of systems (SoS) in every sense of the definition. A.P. Sage and others list five common SoS characteristics: operational independence of the individual systems, managerial independence, geographical distribution, emergent behavior and evolutionary development or independent life cycles. Typical examples include smart houses, the electric grid, complex military systems and so-called smart cities. The future of IoT success, including technology advancements and revenue generating potential across the business spectrum, is dependent on the application of solid Systems Engineering and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) principals. Without MBSE, the complexity involved in the design, development, and deployment of IoT systems would consume both system and operational providers. Absent of any industry standards, IoT systems cannot be built in a vacuum and their success will only be realized through application of modern day systems engineering processes, methods, and tools. With the potential of 28 billion “things” connected to the Internet by 2020, it's not too difficult for anyone paying attention to this emerging technology trend to envision the massive scale of social, economic, and technological changes that will need to occur to realize this prediction. Technology advancements in consumer products will continue to evolve to facilitate connection to larger and larger IoT networks. This will be the catalyst that will drive entire infrastructures changes to: Federal, State, City, and local governments; product development companies; utility and service providers; and even to consumers and their homes in order to support the growing demand for connected products. The infrastructure and management will need to be established prior to, or in conjunction with, the smart systems that support them. This paper will show a traffic management system and connected systems in a large city and how an MBSE and SoS approach will help guide development.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2016.00253.x,,wiley

As the total life cycle of complex Systems and SoS frequently spans across several decades, the customer expectations and market conditions are highly likely to evolve, thus their development needs to be kept in line with evolving business cases. Systems Engineering(SE) and Configuration Management(CM) need to work even more closely together in order to address this. CM as a discipline is essential for this as the key discipline for establishing traceability and controlling baseline evolutions and iterations between all the relevant pieces of information resulting from the related system lifecycle processes. This paper provides an outlook on how CM may enable SE of tomorrow's complex Systems and SoS, including some key recommendations and related challenges.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2016.00288.x,,wiley
1994,REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT: DOORS TO THE BATTLEFIELD OF THE FUTURE,"Abstract The integration of systems to create a stable, robust system of systems poses challenges to systems engineering management when the individual systems already exist, are numerous and rapidly evolving. The Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORSTM) introduces advanced object-oriented techniques to manage the complexity of large numbers of inter-linked requirements. DOORS provides an easy-to-use, online environment. Different on-line views of the project status are available in both text and hierarchical graphical formats by filtering and sorting on the attributes of the objects. This object-oriented approach to requirements management is extended to provide a groupware systems engineering management environment in support of the U.S. Army's program to digitize the battlefield of the future. The Army's intent is to improve their comparative advantage in combat effectiveness over that of potential adversaries. The magnitude and complexity of the effort to manage the project compared to classical requirements management methodologies and tools are discussed.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.1994.tb01683.x,,wiley

2004,4.6.2 A Knowledge Management Approach to Change Management in Systems-of-Systems,"Abstract When a complex entity comprises, for example, a set of individually complex, geographically distributed, evolving systems, the question of how to manage change to such a system-of-systems takes great significance. Not only must change be managed at the level of each component system, it must also be managed across the entire interrelated and interacting set. The solution presented in this paper is based on research that treats a class of warships in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), along with the associated operational, production and support systems, as a system-of-systems (SoS) and examines the management of change in this complex entity. The paper describes a Knowledge Management (KM) strategy that can be used to plan, manage, coordinate and implement change across the entire lifecycle of the target system-of-systems and which may be generalisable to other systems-of-systems.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2004.tb00537.x,,wiley
2004,7.4.2 Europe's First System of Systems,"Abstract Systems thinking is as old as civilization. The question is can today's systems engineers benefit from examining the accomplishments of early system builders? This thought is examined in the context of roman engineering achievements. The birth of the Roman republic around 500 B.C. led to the building of an unprecedented array of remarkable systems. The needs of the republic, followed by those of the empire, produced important advances in building construction, water supply, mining and the building of bridges, roads, harbors, ships. Many complex systems such as the aqueducts supplying Rome's water were created. This paper postulates that the Romans developed Europe's first system of systems. The backbone of the system, a network of roads radiating out from Rome, began as a strategic initiative to maintain government control throughout the empire. Over time, this super system evolved into the means for Romanizing the many different cultures dragged into Rome's dominion. The resulting cultural harmonization left a lasting imprint on the world.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2004.tb00590.x,,wiley
2008,"Geodetic Observations Help Scientists Understand Geohazards and Mitigate Disasters: The GGOS Contribution to GEOSS and an Observing System for Geohazards and Disaster Prevention; Frascati, Italy, 5–6 October 2007","Modern space-geodetic observations have revolutionized our understanding of geohazards, and these observations have a great potential for further scientific discovery and applications, including early warning. To discuss this, about 50 scientists from the geodetic and geohazards communities took part in a workshop organized by the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) as a contribution to the intergovernmental Group on Earth Observations (GEO). Highest-level representatives of space agencies (European Space Agency, NASA, and Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) emphasized the fundamental importance of the geodetic reference frames for satellite missions and Earth observation. Although high, the present accuracy of these reference frames still is a key limitation in quantifying global change processes such as changes in ice sheets and sea level. Improvements of the reference frame are a pivotal step toward a better understanding of these processes and their impact on society. The representative of GEO identified GGOS as a core element in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), which aims to integrate Earth observations in order to better serve users in a number of societal benefit areas, including disasters.",10.1029/2008EO170003,,wiley

2022,Framework for Complex SoS Emergent Behavior Evolution Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Abstract Advances in technology have made it easy to integrate multiple modern systems to form complex system-of-systems (SoS) to achieve unparalleled levels of functionality that are otherwise not achievable by the constituent systems in isolation. In fact, with the recent explosion of machine learning techniques to build autonomous systems such as drones and self-driving cars, there is a pressing need to ensure that they collaboratively and safely operate in an SoS context. However, in general, the characteristic emergent behaviors of complex SoS – that directly impact its operational measures of success or Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) – is very difficult, if not impossible, to manually explore, anticipate, and arbitrate just from knowledge of its underlying systems. Further, there are multiple scenarios of evolution in such complex SoS, including evolution in the emergent behavior of the SoS. The continuous, continual, and evolving nature of the SoS and constituent system environment's state and possible actions, adds further complexity. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning approach, to inculcate adaptable intelligence in constituent systems to adapt their behaviors in tandem with the evolution of emergent behavior at the SoS level. By augmenting the reward mechanism of RL by leveraging SoS-Constituent System MOE Relationship, that relates and ranks System MOEs vs. SoS MOEs, we inculcate an Intelligent-Behavior Evolution Agent, with the necessary constraints to learn to maximize the SoS and system-level MOEs, while adapting itself to the evolution in SoS. We illustrate our approach and demonstrate its feasibility and potential by applying it to a power grid SoS case example. The effectiveness and performance of the approach are quantified.",10.1002/iis2.12965,,wiley

An ecosystem for innovation is a system of systems in its own right, only partly engineered, subject to risks and challenges of evolving socio-technical systems. This paper summarizes an aid to planning, analyzing, implementing, and improving innovation ecosystems. Represented as a configurable model-based Reference pattern used by collaborating INCOSE working groups, it was initially applied in targeted INCOSE case studies, and subsequently elaborated and applied to diverse commercial and defense ecosystems. Explicating the recurrent theme of Consistency Management underlying all historical engineering, it is revealing of Digital Engineering's special promise, and enhances understanding of historical as well as future engineering and life cycle management. It includes preparation of human and technical resources to effectively consume and exploit digital information assets, not just create them, capability enhancements over incremental release trains, and evolutionary steering using feedback and group learning.",10.1002/iis2.12985,,wiley
2022,Multi-Disciplinary Insights into Measurement and Assessment for SoS,"Abstract The assessment of performance and quality is essential to the engineering and evolution of Systems of Systems (SoS); however, there has been limited discussion of SoS measurement and evaluation in the literature. This paper reviews the measurement and assessment literature across multiple disciplines to address this gap and applies constructive research to design principles and concepts for SoS evaluation. Relevant challenges and best practice elements are identified within each discipline for comparison against the nature and characteristics of Systems of Systems. These elements are then synthesized into three key areas necessary for SoS evaluation: measure development, determination of good metrics, and assessment. While further work has been identified and initiated on methods for the generation of such metrics, this study provides practitioners with the core practices and principles necessary to enable tailored and enhanced SoS assessment.",10.1002/iis2.12991,,wiley
2017,Mathematical Characterization of System-of-Systems Attributes,"The practice of complex system engineering has been hampered by a lack of rigorous and consistent language across disciplines. Terms such as “complexity” and “system of systems” have been subject to various verbal definitions that are inconsistent from author to author, and from field to field. Rich literatures in philosophy, management and engineering have the promise of mutual reinforcement and support, but the lack of consistency makes correlation difficult. In this Chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature around the questions of system complexity and systems of systems (SoS). Extending previous work in this area, we offer a package of four set theoretic equations expressing the essential attributes used in constructing taxonomies of system types. They are consistent with the set of attributes evolved by system engineering researchers up to this point, and together they provide a complete description of the taxonomy of systems up to but not including complex SoS. Finally, we examine the attribute of emergence. It remains an open question whether emergence can actually exist in a system made up entirely of engineered components. This has eloquently been posed as the question of emergence versus ignorance—is an unpredictable result truly a feature of the complex system, or merely an artifact of our lack of understanding? We conclude by offering several mathematical approaches that may have promise in extending this system of definitions to include emergence as well.",10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_1,,springerlink
2017,Towards Environmental Analytics: DPSIR as a System of Systems,"DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, States, Impacts, Responses) is a framework addressing the needs of environmental data reporting and assessment, extensively exploited by the European Union, its Member States and associated countries. The DPSIR framework does not model the environment, however it implies a systems model. Making such model explicit allows users to better understand the semantics of the five DPSIR components, therefore improving the harmonization and quality of the reported data, in particular in order to process them as Big Data. To such purpose, the tools provided by the systems theory are useful, specifically the system-of-systems (SoS) point of view. On such basis, a conceptual model of the relationships between the constituent systems of the socio-ecological system (SES) is proposed. As a result of such analysis some possible evolutions of DPSIR are envisaged, in terms of expanded and refined environmental data flows. Such evolutions aim to build a better integrated environmental knowledge base, as a prerequisite to a wider exploitation of analytics for the relevant decision processes and management activities.",10.1007/978-3-319-44711-7_29,,springerlink

First, this paper analyzes the structure of WTSE and builds a multi-view model for WTSE system-of-systems. Subsequently, a model based on system dynamics is constructed after analyzing the causal relations of index with input and task demand for warship technology supportability capabilities, while a growth curve is employed to elaborate the development and evolution process of capabilities.

2017,Practical Security Aspects of the Internet of Things,"Industry 4.0 and with that the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to revolutionize the industrial world. The vast amount of interconnected devices bear the great opportunity to collect valuable information for advancing decision making in management and technology to improve through-life management of a product. Cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Services will revolutionize our current world through fully interconnected communication where information and services are becoming ubiquitous. The availability of information across a system of systems can be very powerful when utilized properly and harnessed adequately. The vast network of small, power-sensitive and often deeply embedded devices that are streaming potentially commercially sensitive data over long periods of time poses an entirely different type of threat than known from the conventional PC world. Adequate and sensible measures need to be taken right at the design stage of IoT devices in order to take best advantage of Industry 4.0 technology. This chapter introduces a set of key security issues related to the implementation of IoT in an industrial mechanical engineering context. A real-world example concerning remote maintenance of CNC machine tools illustrates the different threat scenarios related to IoT in practice. The paper touches on Big Data and Cloud Manufacturing but will remain focused on improving security at the Edge of IoT, i.e. where data is collected, transmitted and eventually transferred back to the physical actuators. The aim of this chapter is to introduce a generic overview of real-world IoT security issues as well as giving a deeper technical example-supported insight into practical considerations for designing IoT systems for practical use in business.",10.1007/978-3-319-50660-9_9,,springerlink
2016,The City: A System of Systems,"Cities are places of human convergence, where people live, work, and play. But beneath the bustle of any city are systems that make these hubs of humanity function. Cities are akin to living things that take in energy, metabolize material, and spit out waste. They consume and grow, using digestive, respiratory, and circulatory systems. And, like living things, cities can, with a nudge from citizens and their leaders, evolve in directions that increase their prospects for survival.",10.5822/978-1-61091-756-8_3,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.5822/978-1-61091-756-8_3,springerlink; googlescholar
2016,Managed Dependability in Interacting Systems,"A digital ICT infrastructure must be considered as a system of systems in itself, but also in interaction with other critical infrastructures such as water distributions, transportation (e.g. Intelligent Transport Systems) and Smart Power Grid control. These systems are characterised by self-organisation, autonomous sub-systems, continuous evolution, scalability and sustainability, providing both economic and social value. Services delivered involve a chain of stakeholders that share the responsibility, providing robust and secure services with stable and good performance. One crucial challenge for the different operation/control centres of the stakeholders is to manage dependability during normal operation, which may be characterised by many failures of minor consequence. In seeking to optimise the utilisation of the available resources with respect to dependability, new functionality is added with the intension to help assist in obtaining situational awareness, and for some parts enable autonomous operation. This new functionality adds complexity, such that the complexity of the (sub)systems and their operation will increase. As a consequence of adding a complex system to handle complexity, the frequency and severity of the consequences of such events may increase. Furthermore, as a side-effect of this, the preparedness will be reduced for restoration of services after a major event (that might involves several stakeholders), such as common software breakdown, security attacks, or natural disaster. This chapter addresses the dependability challenges related to the above-mentioned system changes. It is important to understand how adding complexity to handle complexity will influence the risks, both with respect to the consequences and the probabilities. In order to increase insight, a dependability modelling approach is taken, where the goal is to combine and extend the existing modelling approaches in a novel way. The objective is to quantify different strategies for management of dependability in interacting systems. Two comprehensive system examples are used to illustrate the approach. A software-defined networking example addresses the effect of moving control functionality from being distributed and embedded with the primary function, to be separated and (virtually) centralised. To demonstrate and discuss the consequences of adding more functionality both in the distributed entities serving the primary function, and centralised in the control centre, a Smart Grid system example is studied.",10.1007/978-3-319-30599-8_8,,springerlink
2016,The Present and Future of Large-Scale Systems Modeling and Engineering,"Today’s society and organizations rely on large-scale and ultra-large scale IT systems. Large-scale IT systems drive social and organizational change. We find them as the backbone of what we call the digital society, the digital economy, the fourth industrial revolution and so forth. Large scale-systems show as systems of systems or IT system landscapes. They show as data-intensive systems, workflow-intensive systems, massively resource-intensive systems, highly distributed systems. How to deal with the complexity of large-scale systems? How to approach architecture, design, realization and management of large-scale systems in systematic and rigorous ways? In this talk we attempt a foundational review of modeling and engineering techniques available for large-scale systems. From this, we try to understand possible pathways, both short-term and long-term, of large-scale systems modeling and engineering.",10.1007/978-3-319-48057-2_25,,springerlink
2015,Towards Smart Systems of Systems,"Systems of Systems (SoS) have started to emerge as a consequence of the general trend toward the integration of beforehand isolated systems. To unleash the full potential, the contained systems must be able to operate as elements in open, dynamic, and deviating SoS architectures and to adapt to open and dynamic contexts while being developed, operated, evolved, and governed independently. We name the resulting advanced SoS to be smart as they must be self-adaptive at the level of the individual systems and self-organizing at the SoS level to cope with the emergent behavior at that level. In this paper we analyze the open challenges for the envisioned smart SoS. In addition, we discuss our ideas for tackling this vision with our SMARTSOS approach that employs open and adaptive collaborations and models at runtime. In particular, we focus on preliminary ideas for the construction and assurance of smart SoS.",10.1007/978-3-319-24644-4_1,,springerlink
2015,A System of Systems Framework for Microgrids,"Distributed generation has made its mark in the power distribution system, as a consequence of economic and environmental considerations. With the exponential advancement of technology, unconventional sources of generation, storage, and microturbines have been enhanced. The microgrid has paved its way into distributed generation and looks promising for future prospects. On the other hand, to better cope with the challenges posed by the world today, the transition of systems engineering principles to complex, large-scale, integrated, and evolutionary system of systems (SoS) has occurred. This chapter aims at coupling the concept of microgrid with that of SoS. A framework is proposed for the microgrids, considering its remarkable resemblance to SoS characteristics. The reason for microgrids to be regarded as SoS is discussed and the architecture of microgrids is designed from a SoS point of view. The operation of the microgrid under the proposed framework is presented and the benefits of the framework are expressed. A typical application is considered for simulation.",10.1007/978-3-319-16910-1_5,,springerlink
2015,Multidirectional Modular Conditional Safety Certificates,"Over the last 20 years, embedded systems have evolved from closed, rather static single-application systems towards open, flexible, multi-application systems of systems. While this is a blessing from an application perspective, it certainly is a curse from a safety engineering perspective as it invalidates the base assumptions of established engineering methodologies. Due to the combinatorial complexity and the amount of uncertainty encountered in the analysis of such systems, we believe that more potent modular safety approaches coupled with adequate runtime checks are required. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of an integrated contract-based approach covering vertical dependencies (between platform and application) and horizontal dependencies (between applications) in order to efficiently assure the safety of the whole system of systems through modularization. We integrate both concepts using state-of-the-art research and showcase the application of the integrated approach based on a small industrial case study.",10.1007/978-3-319-24249-1_31,,springerlink

This paper presents a framework for defining and guiding SoS thinking.",10.1007/978-3-030-00114-8_44,,springerlink
2019,The Mobility in Belo Horizonte Through the Macroergonomics and Service Design,"The urban organization passed through successive revolutions over the years, with regards to styles, social-political strategies and impacts in human daily life. These conditions have forced the implementation of new mobility concepts, in which incipient complex structures feature in urban centers. Brazil relies on, primarily, the individual transport through the road/car pair, contradicting the strategic world thinking, in which prevails the intermodal system of transportation. The purpose is analyzing the capital’s transport system, under the macro ergonomic and service design perspective (its organization and physical/psychological impacts on the population). Thus, considering the present situation of Belo Horizonte city, we noted that just implementing new vehicles (MICRO approach) won’t solve the problem, because it doesn’t integrate the urban mobility global system (MACRO approach) – interconnect, in an efficient and safe way, the point of departure to the destiny. The preliminary results point to two directions: A - urban space should be thought as a “system of systems integration” and not just the association/approximation of products; B - the previous concept demands a systemic reading of the MACRO/MICRO, since the intrinsic values must be attacked to the individual and not less to the collective in relation to the organized society.",10.1007/978-3-319-96074-6_50,,springerlink
2018,A Sustainable System-of-Systems Approach: Identifying the Important Boundaries for a Target System in Human Factors and Ergonomics,"The problems now facing humanity are complex and rapidly evolving. In fact, these problems even threaten our very existence as a species. The sustainable system-of-systems model, which has been developed to help characterise the various different levels of human factors and ergonomics approaches to dealing with these problems, is explained and critiqued this chapter. We then look at the various possible ways to address the “fuzzy boundary” problem of complex adaptive systems for human factors and ergonomics. These possible solutions include the Pareto Principle, Stakeholder Salience Theory, Soft Systems Methodology, and Network Theory. The example of the design of a green building workplace layout is used to illustrate the concepts. The chapter concludes with a critique of what we consider to be the most promising of these solutions at present, the Network Theory.",10.1007/978-981-10-8072-2_2,,springerlink

As the needs grow for more sustainable, reliable, and affordable services in smart cities, the system requirements and interoperability needs also grow. Standards Standards are developed to enable and support such technology needs but working with complex systems requires a more systematic and holistic approach. This chapter walks through the evolution of the electric meter and how it has evolved into an advanced, data generating device that is part of a larger system. Then, we examine the role of the standards community and its adaptation to a more systems perspective. The chapter ends in examining the systems life cycle and key factors in evaluating complex systems for the development of standards.",10.1007/978-3-319-59381-4_3,,springerlink
2018,HyVar,"The HyVar project ( www.hyvar-project.eu/ ) proposes a development framework for continuous and individualized evolution of distributed software applications running on remote devices in heterogeneous environments, focusing on the automotive domain. The framework combines variability modeling and software reuse from software product lines with formal methods and software upgrades and can be integrated in existing software development processes. HyVar’s objectives are: (O1) To develop a Domain Specific Variability Language (DSVL) and tool chain to support software variability for highly distributed applications; (O2) to develop a cloud infrastructure that exploits software variability as described in the DSVL to track the software configurations deployed on remote devices and to enable (i) the collection of data from the devices to monitor their behavior; and (ii) secure and efficient customized updates; (O3) to develop a technology for over-the-air updates of distributed applications, which enables continuous software evolution after deployment on complex remote devices that incorporate a system of systems; and (O4) to test HyVar’s approach as described in the above objectives in an industry-led demonstrator to assess in quantifiable ways its benefits. The end of the project is approaching and we are close to reaching all the objectives. In this paper, we present the integrated tool chain, which combines formal reuse through software product lines with commonly used industrial practices, and supports the development and deployment of individualized software adaptations. We also describe the main benefits for the stakeholders involved.",10.1007/978-3-319-79090-9_12,,springerlink
2010,System of Systems Challenges,"The available technology (e.g., the Internet) makes it possible to interconnect independently developed embedded systems ( legacy systems ) to form new system-of-systems (SoS) thatpromise more efficient economic processes and improved services. Examples of SoSs are smart power distribution , car-to-car communication , or air-traffic control . The different sub-systems of an SoS are developed according to their unique architectural style , are operated by different organization and serve their own purposes. The integration of the subsystems into an SoS can be static or dynamic. The emergent properties that come into existence by the integration of the sub-systems can be predicted or are, at first, unforeseen . There a number of unique challenges in the design of system of systems such as, for example: the alignment of the diverse architectural styles, the control of the emergent properties, information security, and the provision of dependable service in the face of the continuous evolution of the subsystems.

2009,Algorithms and Applications for Land Cover Classification – A Review,"During the last decades the manner how the Earth is being observed was revolutionized. Earth Observation (EO) systems became a valuable and powerful tool to monitor the Earth and had significant impact on the acquisition and analysis of environmental data (Rosenquist et al. 2003). Currently, EO data play a major role in supporting decision-making and surveying compliance of several multilateral environmental treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on Biological Diversity, or the European initiative Global Monitoring for Environment and Security, GMES (Peter 2004, Rosenquist et al. 2003, Backhaus and Beule 2005). However, the need for such long-term monitoring of the Earth’s surface requires the standardized and coordinated use of global EO data sets, which has led, e.g., to the international Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) initiative as well as to the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS) implementation plan (GCOS 2004, GEO 2005).

2008,Systems Thinking for the Enterprise: A Thought Piece,"This paper suggests a way of managing the acquisition of capabilities for large-scale government enterprises that is different from traditional “specify and build” approaches commonly employed by U.S. government agencies in acquiring individual systems or systems of systems (SoS). Enterprise capabilities evolve through the emergence and convergence of information and other technologies and their integration into social, institutional and operational organizations and processes. Enterprise capabilities evolve whether or not the enterprise has processes in place to actively manage them. Thus the critical role of enterprise system engineering (ESE) processes should be to shape, enhance and accelerate the “natural” evolution of enterprise capabilities. ESE processes do not replace or add a layer to traditional system engineering (TSE) processes used in developing individual systems or SoS. ESE processes should complement TSE processes by shaping outcome spaces and stimulating interactions among enterprise participants through marketlike mechanisms to reward those that create innovation which moves and accelerates the evolution of the enterprise.",10.1007/978-3-540-85081-6_69,,springerlink
2008,Interoperability of Information Systems in Crisis Management: Crisis Modeling and Metamodeling,"In a crisis situation (natural disaster, industrial accident, etc.) several partners have to act simultaneously to solve the emergency situation. Their coordination in such a context is a crucial point, especially in the first moments of the crisis. Their interoperability (precisely their Information Systems interoperability) is a major component of the success of the network. ISyCri ^17 French project propose to tackle this topic according to two aspects: (i) responsiveness of the network (its ability to act rapidly and efficiently) and (ii) flexibility of the obtained system of systems (its ability to evolve and follow the changing situation). This is so an agility problem of ISs of partners.

2006,Spiral Lifecycle Increment Modeling for New Hybrid Processes,"The spiral lifecycle is being extended to address new challenges for Software-Intensive Systems of Systems (SISOS), such as coping with rapid change while simultaneously assuring high dependability. A hybrid plan-driven and agile process has been outlined to address these conflicting challenges with the need to rapidly field incremental capabilities. A system dynamics model has been developed to assess the incremental hybrid process and support project decision-making. It estimates cost and schedule for multiple increments of a hybrid process that uses three specialized teams. It considers changes due to external volatility and feedback from user-driven change requests, and dynamically re-estimates and allocates resources in response to the volatility. Deferral policies and team sizes can be experimented with, and it includes tradeoff functions between cost and the timing of changes within and across increments, length of deferral delays, and others. Both the hybrid process and simulation model are being evolved on a very large scale incremental project and other potential pilots.",10.1007/11754305_19,,springerlink
2004,Singapore and the Revolution in Military Affairs,"Singapore’s military capability is, by most measures, the most advanced in Southeast Asia. The buildup of Singapore’s armed forces and its national defense industry, as well as local defense research and development (R&D), reflects the determination of the People’s Action Party (PAP) government to ensure the city-state’s survival in a potentially hostile regional environment. However, these developments would not have been possible if Singapore had not possessed such a highly developed economy and well-educated population. These advantages, reinforced by increasingly intense interaction with the armed forces and defense industries of advanced industrial countries, have allowed Singapore to make substantial strides toward participation in the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) since the 1990s. Singapore has fielded increasingly sophisticated defense systems, particularly in the RMA-critical areas of precision weapons, command, control, communications, and computer-processing (C4), and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). Integrated logistic support (ILS) is also well developed. Though the doctrinal and organizational innovation required to implement the RMA is so far rather less well advanced, Singapore seems to have made substantial progress toward establishing a relatively low cost “system of systems,” which will far outclass the military capabilities of other Southeast Asian states for at least the next decade. And although Singapore’s government has become increasingly concerned over asymmetric threats, it is clearly determined to maintain its emphasis on developing high-technology conventional military capabilities.",10.1057/9781403980441_9,,springerlink

2020,Liability in Collaborative Maintenance of Critical System of Systems,"Our society is facing a growing dependency on services supported by multiple interconnected computing and cyberphysical artifacts, constituting complex systems-of-systems. Such dependence means that a web of technology suppliers and IT departments have the responsibility to guarantee the operational quality of such systems. In this scenario where dependable services are maintained and evolved by networks of organizations, the question is how to ensure a liability framework able to reduce or help to solve potential legal conflicts. This work on liability in Collaborative Maintenance of Critical System of Systems grounds on previous research on the open Informatics system of systems (ISoS) framework.

2021,Theory of language: a taxonomy,"The study of language has been historically proposed as a model for human sciences. For the structuralists, it is because languages, like society, and cultural habits, are man-made rule-based systems. For the Darwinists, it is because cultures and societies are like living species, and can be studied with biological methodology. Sociology, biology and linguistics are considered analogous in different ways. To support work in theoretical and applied linguistics, this paper discusses the problem of the nature of language, investigating how the question “What is language?” has been approached from different angles. Textbook answers guide us in many different directions: language is a tool for communication—and for thinking. It is a collection of words and instructions how to use them. It is the characteristic which—arguably—separates humans from other animals. It is a social construction, a system of symbols, a system of systems, and so on. To classify perspectives, the intellectual history of schools of linguistic thought is examined, connecting linguistic theory with related disciplines. A taxonomy is proposed based on two axes: humanistic versus biological; and historical versus systemic. Main linguistics frameworks are identified and placed into a fourfold table based on these axes. They include the Bloomfieldian school (Type 1); Saussurean structuralism and its derivatives (Type 2); generative grammar and biolinguistics (Type 3); and cognitive‒evolutionary linguistics (Type 4).",10.1007/s43545-021-00085-x,,springerlink

This will provide the background against which we will discuss new research challenges, lying at the intersection of control and computation. First, current practices and trends in robotic systems are reviewed. Second, future maritime operations are discussed with reference to a paradigm shift: from robotic systems to systems of robotic systems. Finally, the control and computation challenges posed by future robotic operations are discussed in the framework of cyber-physical systems in which physical and computational entities co-evolve, interact, and communicate in an environment that can also be modified by the actions of these entities. This will be done with reference to modular design, systems of systems, models of systems with evolving structure, optimization and execution control for extended space-control spaces, and hierarchical control architectures.",10.1007/978-3-030-44184-5_100116,,springerlink; springerlink
2022,A model-driven approach to machine learning and software modeling for the IoT,"Models are used in both Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). SE models may specify the architecture at different levels of abstraction and for addressing different concerns at various stages of the software development life-cycle, from early conceptualization and design, to verification, implementation, testing and evolution. However, AI models may provide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision-making support. For instance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is currently the most popular sub-discipline of AI, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the observed data and can become capable of making predictions. The goal of this work is to create synergy by bringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic approach to model-driven software development for intelligent systems that require ML. We illustrate how software models can become capable of creating and dealing with ML models in a seamless manner. The main focus is on the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where both ML and model-driven SE play a key role. In the context of the need to take a Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems perspective of the targeted architecture, an integrated design environment for both SE and ML sub-systems would best support the optimization and overall efficiency of the implementation of the resulting system. In particular, we implement the proposed approach, called ML-Quadrat, based on ThingML, and validate it using a case study from the IoT domain, as well as through an empirical user evaluation. It transpires that the proposed approach is not only feasible, but may also contribute to the performance leap of software development for smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) which are connected to the IoT, as well as an enhanced user experience of the practitioners who use the proposed modeling solution.",10.1007/s10270-021-00967-x,,springerlink

In this paper, we employ the service-oriented architectural paradigm, as materialized in the Eclipse Arrowhead framework, to represent modern systems engineering principles and their open structural principles and, thus, relevance to flexible and adaptive systems. As for adequately capturing the structural aspect, we propose using model-based engineering techniques and, in particular, a SysML-based specialization of systems modeling. The approach is illustrated by a real-life use-case in industrial automation.",10.1007/s11334-022-00455-5,,springerlink
2022,MBSE for System-of-Systems,"A System-of-Systems (SoS) is a special kind of complex system in which new capabilities arise from interacting components that are controlled with varying degrees of independence by multiple owner/operators. Thus, the capabilities generated by an SoS are not merely a sum of the capabilities of individual constituent systems, but instead are an emergent property stemming from their interactions. Thus, SoS behavior over time is highly dependent on the dynamic and evolving character of those interaction. Further, the architecture of an SoS consists not only of the constituent systems, but of their interfaces and the communication and exchanges occurring between the systems. In this context, model-based system engineering methods, processes, and tools are especially important for supporting desired evolutionary development of the SoS as the architecture is almost always in a state of flux. This chapter draws on a combination of theory and experience with practical projects to describe three examples of important model-based functions in SoS Engineering (SoSE), a tailored approach for building effective SoSE models, and vignettes of these approaches in practice.

2022,History of Engineering Systems Design Research and Practice,"This chapter reviews developments in engineering systems design from antiquity to the present day, noting especially the continual increase in recent years in the sophistication and interconnectedness of engineered artefacts, and development, from the late nineteenth century, of vast networks for energy, communications, and transportation. Large projects required enormous engineering effort from substantial and often distributed teams, while the networks that developed were “partially designed, partially evolved” with their design and configuration influenced by global actors. These engineering developments led to the need for new tools, methods, and approaches to support engineers in their work, and these are reviewed, beginning with the introduction of drawings – measured plans – and developing through design methods to systems engineering and project management in the latter part of the twentieth century. Concurrently, there was the emergence in the scientific community of the notion of a system, which led to new scientific studies, from systems analysis and cybernetics to network science and soft systems methodology. These various strands have come together at the beginning of the twenty-first century to a multifaceted present state, in which many different lines of research and practice may be brought to bear on the engineering systems design challenges of the century, of complex systems of systems, and their interaction with an increasingly overburdened natural world.",10.1007/978-3-030-81159-4_2,,springerlink; springerlink
2022,Resilience of Smart Integrated Energy Systems,"Energy systems, particularly power systems as critical infrastructures, are of supreme importance to society. The current significant developments, namely evolving producer and consumer characteristics (e.g., volatile and hard-to-predict renewables), higher growth of sector-coupling solutions, and on top, sophisticated control and digitalization solutions – transforming the energy systems into a complex cyber-physical system of systems – jeopardize the operation of the overall system. If it fails to make the new energy system as robust and resilient as the current system, the consequences can be drastic and a threat to society. This chapter defines the resilience concept and presents the current practices and methods to evaluate and enhance the resilience of smart energy systems. To this end, after providing a comprehensive background to the paradigm shift, resilience metrics suggested by communities such as IEEE and Cigré are presented – focusing mainly on power systems. A multi-domain approach that outlines resilience indexes for heat, gas, and electricity sectors is also presented to as a more holistic methodology. In addition, it is explained how emerging technologies such as digital twins and artificial intelligence can support the evaluation of system resilience. This chapter also motivates key resilience strategies and addresses the state-of-art approaches in two important categories: (1) situational awareness and system knowledge and (2) operational flexibility and adaptive mechanism. Different examples of these categories, such as anomaly-aware monitoring systems, software-defined networking, and cellular concepts, are provided here – from mutually cyber and physical viewpoints.",10.1007/978-3-030-72322-4_109-1,,springerlink; springerlink

It starts with a nod to realism Realism by treating legally recognized territorial states Territorial states as units in a global system System , and by defining geopolitics Geopolitics as the spatial relations Spatial relations among such units. However, the chapter also takes stock of a variety of underlying systems System (cultural, economic, and even institutional) that tend to flow across states’ borders Border . States are the most important element in this ‘ system System of systems System ,’ because the political sphere maintains the consensus necessary for the other systems System to function. They do so by managing changes in the other systems System while maintaining social peace Peace ; therefore, political crises at all scales Scale —from micro-level unrests to widespread war War —are indicators of systemic transformations that states are not able to manage. Such an approach enables interpreting the long-term development of globalization Globalization in terms of equilibrium Equilibrium , a concept borrowed from economics.

Increased level of outsourcing, significant amount of subcontractors, more integration than development, reduced project cycles, ecosystem like collaborative developments, software product lines and global development are some of the changes in the project life cycle approaches. By structuring data into views with a common language and format, architecture frameworks can be utilized as tools for managing system complexity. In EADS, both architecture frameworks and MBSE are considered as major areas in the future of contemporary systems engineering practices. In this paper, we share our experiences towards adopting MBSE in border security projects where the role of EADS is the system of systems integrator. From the practitioner’s point of view, lessons learned presented in this paper can help companies to increase the speed of shift from traditional systems engineering approaches to architecture driven, knowledge focused and model-based systems engineering practices.",10.1007/978-3-319-02812-5_21,,springerlink
2014,Towards Trust Assurance and Certification in Cyber-Physical Systems,"We are currently witnessing a 3^rd industrial revolution, driven by ever more interconnected distributed systems of systems, running under the umbrella term of cyber-physical systems (CPS). In the context of this paradigm, different types of computer-based systems from different application domains collaborate with each other in order to render higher level services that could not be rendered by single systems alone. However, the tremendous potential of CPS is inhibited due to significant engineering challenges with respect to the systems safety and security. Traditional methodologies are not applicable to CPS without further ado and new solutions are therefore required. In this paper, we present potential solution ideas that are currently investigated by the European EMC² research project.",10.1007/978-3-319-10557-4_21,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10557-4_21,springerlink; googlescholar
2014,Towards an Ontology of SoS Interoperability: Proposition of a SoS Interoperability Framework and a SoS Conceptual Interoperability Model,"Systems engineering is currently evolving to extend beyond the scope of a single system. Recently, the increasing number of interacting systems in society and industry generated a growing interest in a class of complex systems, called Systems of Systems (SoS), whose components are complex and independent. There is a growing interest for the creation of synergies between these component systems to achieve the desired performance of the overall system (SoS). The SoS approach is intended to build and analyze complex, independent and heterogeneous systems working (or designed to work) in cooperation. The SoS concept presents a high level perspective that explains the interactions between the independent systems. In the context of SoS engineering, interoperability is one of the most challenging problems. The aim of this paper is to present an interoperability framework and a conceptual model to formally structure knowledge about SoS Engineering and build an Ontology of SoS Interoperability (OoSoSI).",10.1007/978-3-319-07215-9_7,,springerlink
2014,The Role of Information and Communication Technology in the Development of Early Warning Systems for Geological Disasters: The Tsunami Show Case,"Tsunami warning systems (TWS) are distributed software and hardware systems supporting the reliable detection of imminent tsunami hazards, the rapid situation assessment and the targeted dissemination of customised warning messages. The conceptual evolution of TWS within the last decades is stimulated by and depending on the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The strong influence of ICT emerged in the 1980s when the availability of microcomputer systems and telecommunication facilities facilitated the development of global sensor networks. Since the 1990 s the growth of the Internet has driven standardisation processes for protocols, interfaces and data exchange, providing the foundations for today’s TWS. The ongoing development of global warning infrastructures depends on the capability to integrate national and local TWS into system-of-systems. This requires structured software engineering methodologies guided by a reference architecture for TWS. Trends such as cloud computing, ubiquitous sensing and volunteered geographic information will strongly influence the future development of TWS.",10.1007/978-3-642-12233-0_12,,springerlink
2014,System Governance: Emergence of Practical Perspectives Across the Disciplines,"As the eventual concept of governance Governance has yet to emerge, traditional sources of power and authority symbols will always be at risk of falling short or even failing catastrophically. This is a daunting challenge since the actual governance Governance landscape have dynamically evolved far more sophisticatedly than the usual well-framed “control” models that are embedded within traditional domains of administrative, public administration and political theories. The purpose of this paper is to articulate an alternative analysis of governance Governance -relevant themes based on systems theoretic principles. This study utilizes a system-of-systems (SoS) conceptualization of governance Governance that relates (1) a ‘governed’ system—the target of governance Governance , with (2) a ‘governing’ system—the direct controller of the ‘governed’ system, (3) a ‘metagovernance’ systems—a metasystem that strategically influences the ‘governing’ system directly and the ‘governed’ system indirectly, and (4) its contextual environment—as anything external to the supposed SoS boundary. The paper will discuss how the symbols of governance Governance that perpetuate “myths of control” thinking within the emergent infranomics Infranomics discourse will be better understood incorporating for instance pluralist perspectives, role of the observer, and information—a few example of concepts and principles that are well-articulated in systems-based theories and approaches. The main contribution of this study is a set of systems-based ideas representing governance Governance that will continue to remain relevant in spite of emergent problems and increased complexity.",10.1007/978-3-319-02493-6_18,,springerlink
2014,Infrastructure Modeling: Status and Applications,"Protecting the Nation’s infrastructure from intentional attacks and natural disasters, including extreme weather events and climate change, is a major national security concern that has only become more critical since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 (This chapter focuses on the work performed at LANL concerning the protection of the critical infrastructures of the United States (the ‘Nation’); however the modeling concepts discussed here are generally applicable). Understanding potential weaknesses of infrastructure assets and how interdependencies across critical infrastructure affect their behavior is essential to predicting and mitigating single and cascading failures, as well as to planning for response and recovery and future infrastructure development. Modeling and simulation (M&S) is an indispensable part of characterizing this complex system of systems and anticipating its response to disruptions. With the advent of more sophisticated infrastructure M&S capabilities, the possible applications have expanded to include the security challenges faced by the U.S. military, which relies on sustainable energy resources and needs to address environmental challenges and husband its water resources. Another key area where infrastructure modeling can play a critical role is in addressing global warming concerns given changes in available technology, evolution of the energy mix toward renewable resources, and many other infrastructure-related factors. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), a U.S. Department of Energy research laboratory tasked with national and energy security concerns, is at the forefront in the development of sophisticated infrastructure M&S capabilities and provides timely analysis of natural and manmade challenges to the infrastructure. This chapter explores the use of infrastructure models by presenting a representative cross- section of the models developed at LANL and some of the analyses completed with them.",10.1007/978-94-007-7161-1_19,,springerlink
2013,Architectures for Evolving System of Systems in Complex Environments,The paper describes design methods for designing a system of systems. Here a system must be designed to both carry out its function and also to fit in with other systems. Design goes beyond optimizing one system but must provide ways to sustain relationships between systems in open complex environments. The nature of a system of systems is complex as individual systems must respond to any changes in related systems. They are characterized by continuous emergence and the need to maintain system integration as systems change and support creativity and innovation. The paper describes architectural framework made up of two parts that provides a structure to model systems and their emergence. The first is an open system structure that models organizational structures that can evolve. This goes beyond the traditional hierarchical systems used in many models. Instead it sees organizational structures as collaborating open systems that are gradually leading to a social rather than hierarchical structure. The second is the collaborative architecture based on social networking superimposed on the structure to model collaboration between the systems. It thus combines social networking and an open model of business systems to provide a unified framework to model a system of systems.,10.1007/978-1-4614-7540-8_15,,springerlink
2013,Composing Distributed Systems: Overcoming the Interoperability Challenge,"Software systems are increasingly composed of independently-developed components, which are often systems by their own. This composition is possible only if the components are interoperable , i.e., are able to work together in order to achieve some user task(s). However, interoperability is often hampered by the differences in the data types, communication protocols, and middleware technologies used by the components involved. In order to enable components to interoperate despite these differences, mediators that perform the necessary data translations and coordinate the components’ behaviours appropriately, have been introduced. Still, interoperability remains a critical challenge for today’s and even more tomorrow’s distributed systems that are highly heterogeneous and dynamic. This chapter introduces the fundamental principles and solutions underlaying interoperability in software systems with a special focus on protocols. First, we take a software architecture perspective and present the fundamentals for reasoning about interoperability and bring out mediators as a key solution to achieve protocol interoperability. Then, we review the solutions proposed for the implementation, synthesis, and dynamic deployment of mediators. We show how these solutions still fall short in automatically solving the interoperability problem in the context of systems of systems. This leads us to present the solution elaborated in the context of the European Connect project, which revolves around the notion of emergent middleware, whereby mediators are synthesised on the fly. We consider the GMES (Global Monitoring of Environment and Security) initiative and use it to illustrate the different solutions presented.",10.1007/978-3-642-40615-7_6,,springerlink

It addresses user- and service-aspects in recently opened LTE networks, and identifies the system challenges. The main challenges are related to radio coverage, especially for the provision of high data rates for indoor users. The paper covers also network-, user- and service-authentication as well as user and society requirements. 5G is addressed as a system of systems in order to provide service continuity. It addresses both technology challenges, user related issues and operator revenue. Collaborative radio and a system availability beacon are discussed to cope with heterogeneity in 5G.

2020,Towards a knowledge base to support global change policy goals,"
ABSTRACTIn 2015, it was adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The year after, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) officially came into force. In 2015, GEO (Group on Earth Observation) declared to support the implementation of SDGs. The GEO Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) required a change of paradigm, moving from a data-centric approach to a more knowledge-driven one. To this end, the GEO System-of-Systems (SoS) framework may refer to the well-known Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) paradigm. In the context of an Earth Observation (EO) SoS, a set of main elements are recognized as connecting links for generating knowledge from EO and non-EO data – e.g. social and economic datasets. These elements are: Essential Variables (EVs), Indicators and Indexes, Goals and Targets. Their generation and use requires the development of a SoS KB whose management process has evolved the GEOSS Software Ecosystem into a GEOSS Social Ecosystem. This includes: collect, formalize, publish, access, use, and update knowledge. ConnectinGEO project analysed the knowledge necessary to recognize, formalize, access, and use EVs. The analysis recognized GEOSS gaps providing recommendations on supporting global decision-making within and across different domains.",10.1080/17538947.2018.1559367,,taylorandfrancis
2018,"A tale of two allied defence departments: new assurance initiatives for managing increasing system complexity, interconnectedness and vulnerability","
AbstractOver the last three decades, defence communication and information systems have been increasing the complexity and interconnectedness of systems that has pervaded society more broadly throughout the Information Age. Even more than society in the broad, Western Departments of Defence (DoDs) have sought to attain information dominance. The result has been a large number of complex systems, system-of-systems and families-of-system-of-systems. In seeking to assure such interconnected systems, defence forces initially focused on specifying the high-level functions that this interconnectivity enabled: first command and control (1970s), then adding communications and computers (1980s) and finally adding intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (1990s); all while defining connections through interoperability protocols. The ability of highly interconnected systems to enable higher order human thinking has arguably gone beyond functions and even the informational, leading to synthetic systems. Furthermore, evolving cyber threats are now seeking to exploit the vulnerabilities of the broad informational attack surfaces of these complex DoD systems. This paper examines the key assurance initiatives pursued by the U.S. DoD to effect these more integrated, interoperable and information-assured (I3) capabilities while ensuring resilience to cyber threats. These approaches are compared to the Australian DoD’s assurance strategies and recommendations made on how Australia could substantially recover I3 assurance with the U.S. and other allied forces. The contrast between the two allies makes this a useful reflection for DoDs in other countries, and more generally to society’s assurance strategies.",10.1080/14488388.2018.1426407,,taylorandfrancis
2015,The Sicilian MUOS Ground Station Conflict: On US Geopolitics in the Mediterranean and Geographies of Resistance,"
AbstractThis paper analyses the alternative territorialities that characterise the conflict on the installation of a US military MUOS ground station in Sicily (Italy). On the one hand, the proponents see territory from a techno-centric vision as a site of strategic importance for the global politics of securitisation since it serves the optimisation of the US military ‘system of systems’. On the other hand, the No-MUOS mobilisation resists this image of territory by claiming it as a place of everyday life, and opposes hegemonic territorialisation through the manipulation of an ensemble of discursive and practical mediators within different spheres of action. The local conflict around a radar infrastructure evolves into a clash between different logics of territorial organisation: a conflict mostly concerning the control over spatial borders, knowledge production, and imaginary circulation.",10.1080/14650045.2015.1006361,,taylorandfrancis
2005,Brain Structures and Ego States,"
AbstractThis article, the sequel to an earlier publication entitled “Mind Structures and Ego States” (Hine, 1997), considers recent research on neural functioning and its implications for the meaning of terms such as “ego,” “self,” and “mind.” The author draws, in particular, on the work of neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux (LeDoux, 2002; Nader, Schafe, & LeDoux, 2003). She joins a current of thinking in neuroscience that proposes that the sense of self as an entity is not an abstract metaphysical state but a product of the complex systems, and systems of systems, of neurons and their accompanying synaptic activity that underlie the development of such subjective experiences as self and mind. Insight into this synaptic activity is offered through the analysis of how sense is made of a set of common ambiguous pictures. Also drawing on the work of Stern (1985) and Nelson and Gruendel (1981), the author suggests a theory of Generalized Representations to describe the way this sense can be built up by babies and brains into the complex systems we call ego states. The connections between this understanding and transactional analysis are discussed, including some of the implications for our evolving understanding of the Parent, Adult, and Child systems, therapeutic interventions, and stroking and discounting processes. In addition, the article focuses on the interconnections among three levels of human functioning: the whole personality, mental process, and neural activity.",10.1177/036215370503500106,,taylorandfrancis

1999,Organizational learning dominance: The emerging key to success in the New Era of warfare,"
AbstractThis article identifies and defines the concept of organizational‐learning dominance as a key to success in the new era of warfare that is currently being shaped by the unfolding revolution in military affairs. Organizational‐learning dominance is defined as the ability to understand, revise, or reverse expectations about “what works and what does not” more rapidly than one's opponent. Central to organizational learning dominance are “windows of opportunity,” which can be exploited if the side to which the advantage accrues recognizes the opportunity and acts to exploit it before the vulnerable side recognizes the nature of the danger and acts to create an effective hedge or accommodation. The article shows how the centrality of “systems of systems” to operational effectiveness in the new form of warfare makes the potential impact of each window of opportunity more unpredictable and potentially more extensive, with effects rapidly crossing warfare areas and imposing strategic consequences across global distances. The article then examines how organizational learning dominance may be supported by “learning acceleration techniques” centering on data collection and dissemination and the realtime integration of studies and simulation with remote, engaged forces. The article also discusses how adversaries may employ reflexive control techniques, adjusting their own operations to impair the opponent's ability to learn and compensate.",10.1080/01495939908403173,,taylorandfrancis
2019,Toward Smart System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) Management: An Evolving Toolbox Approach,This paper discusses the need for an Evolving Toolbox in the field of SoSE management. A new paradigm is needed now to cope with ever-increasing levels of complexity that occur within engineered SoS. This paper proposes an Evolving Toolbox which will allow SoSE management to become smart. The Evolving Toolbox will have several features necessary in successfully managing SoS. An initial range of toolsets is suggested. These toolsets interact inside the toolbox allowing emergence to occur. The toolbox is open to the external environment and so the tools can adapt. There is also the capacity for newly emerging tools to be integrated into the toolbox. This proposal will lead to more efficient and effective management and could have implications for standardization and certification in SoSE. New tools can emerge within the cloud including tools which are proprietary to SoS.,,,webofscience
2017,Emergence as Innovation in Systems of Systems - a Three Systems Model,"While emergence tends to be discussed as an outcome of a system of systems (SoS), it should be viewed as a process. Emergence is often the result of innovation within an SoS. We contend that, because of the complex adaptive nature of SoS, the assessment of the potential for innovation to create positive change is necessary for effective evolutionary planning. Innovation potential represents the convergence of three systems: the system of interest, the innovation system, and the context where these interact and come together. The three-system model is a useful perspective to assess the potential impact of innovation on the evolution of an SoS, and to describe the context of SoS emergence as enabled or constrained by its innovation system. We describe a set of methods and tools adapted from both SoS engineering and human-centered design which can be used for strategic design and planning of SoS evolution. The methods and tools are discussed with respect to the potential emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into the context of urban transportation systems, a complex adaptive SoS.",,,webofscience

The most fundamental of enterprise purposes are manifest in enterprise operations, in which the enterprise interacts with the larger world external to itself, and this aspect of enterprise dynamics is modeled SoSE is but one aspect of an enterprise's activities, and the whole set of enterprise activities is predominantly oriented towards accomplishing and supporting the enterprise's mission in operations.

2017,Revisiting The Meaning of Of as a Theory for Collaborative System of Systems,"At the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems of Systems Engineering, Boardman and Sauser presented a set of characteristics based on an integrative review of the literature. These characteristics are the foundation of the Boardman-Sauser system of systems (SoS) theory. We accept this theory as the basis of collaborative SoS and desire a means to validate this assertion. While numerous simulations have been published, the target SoS is usually a specific implementation. These specialized simulations produce results applicable primarily to the system under study but not necessarily SoS in general. Simulating the mathematical model of the Boardman-Sauser SoS theory in the form of an agent-based model produces results that can be compared with chemical reactions. This paper contends that the formation ofmolecules from atoms is an analog of systems forming any collaborative SoS, which we call our molecule organization model. The result is a supported logical argument that validates the Boardman-Sauser SoS theory as definitive of a generic SoS with behavior applicable to collaborative SoS. This paper seeks to provide a unique contribution to the SoS body of knowledge by increasing our understanding of collaboration in an SoS, so we may better understand their health, maintenance, replication, and evolution.",10.1109/JSYST.2015.2430755,,webofscience

It consists of a system decomposition method using ontologies, a modular agent based model and a knowledge feedback process. The framework was developed and used in a study on fostering biobased cluster evolution in the Eemsdelta, the Netherlands. To support regional development authorities who must balance the interest of each company and the system-of-systems network metrics were developed and incorporated in the simulation. Use of the framework creates a socially accepted model for systems-of-systems analysis that can directly be converted into live simulations to visualize possible directions of its evolution, which results can be used to feedback to the knowledge process.",,,webofscience
2014,From Embedded Systems to Systems of Systems,"Most of today's machines, e.g., automotive engines, production machinery or even consumer devices, such as a washing machine, are controlled by an embedded computer system. It is assumed that the widespread integration of these existing embedded computer systems and data bases into systems-of-systems (e.g., the Internet of Things, IoT) will provide new synergistic services, make better use of the available information, lead to new insights, improve current economic processes and thus create greater wealth. Fueled by the dramatic technological progress in the area of wire-bound and wire-less communication, this integration is already happening on a wide scale in industry. From the viewpoint of computer science, the domain of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a relatively new field that poses significant new research challenges. In our view, the differentiating characteristics of a SoS compared to a monolithic system are the autonomy of the Constituent Systems (CS), emergent phenomena at the SoS level, uncoordinated evolution of the CSs and most, importantly, that the occurrence of faults in the CSs must be considered normal during the operation an SoS. This presentation will focus on the issues that are posed by the integration of embedded systems into systems of systems and will refer to the research approach taken in the European AMADEOS project 610535 (Architecture for Multi-criticality Agile Dependable Evolutionary Open System-of-Systems).",10.1109/ISORC.2014.58,,webofscience
2022,"Future Cities as a system of systems: Its concept, mechanism and creation","As information technology advances rapidly, cities have become more complex and irreducible. In the Anthropocene, the process of planetary urbanization continues to affect the health of the natural and social environment, and the future of cities has a profound impact on the future of mankind. The concept of Future Cities is based on the scrutiny of the urban evolution process in human history. Future Cities are different from agricultural cities as the containers of human settlement and industrial cities as the center of production. Based on interdisciplinary and rational thinking, research on Future Cities aims to establish a way toward humanity's well-being and sustainable development. From the perspective of a system of systems, Future Cities cannot be regarded as a single system as is usual. They are a much more complex system involving many systems, and this concept needs to be understood and interpreted through systems thinking. The driving force for the change is the information revolution, which has changed the carrier of information from entity to data. Thus, information as a medium has improved its operational efficiency and strengthened the interaction and interoperation between the systems in Future Cities, which emphasizes systemhood than thinghood, and triggers the formation of a system of systems. When data-based information penetrates the urban space, the information space emerges, and Future Cities become a combination of physical-information-social space. The information space also opens a new dimension for systems and people in Future Cities. As for systems, technological inventions take place in the process of digitization and informatization, including human settlement systems, energy systems, traffic systems, health systems, and environmental systems. With regard to individuals, a human being becomes human being + information terminals, which in turn gives birth to new lifestyles and brings social innovation. Furthermore, because of the flow of information, the boundaries of different systems will blur and the gap between the systems and inhabitants will be bridged, and the well-being of humankind can be guaranteed through the precise matching of supply and demand. The creation of Future Cities requires not only bottom-up strength and self-organization but also top-down guidance and effective regulation. Urban problems need to be solved in stages from the aspects of technology invention and social innovation. When Future Cities revolve around the people themselves, people's creation of the city will return to normal life, enhancing the sense of happiness and belonging. How to stimulate the vitality of people's creativity, form a cooperative power distribution mechanism, and improve the city's ability to self-organize and operate will be important issues for future urban society. Future Cities research is a combination of theory and practice, which should adapt to the characteristics of a system of systems. Based on the practical experience of urban strategic planning and system engineering, the research can form an overall strategic group for the design of the system of systems, to make full use of multidisciplinary advantages and diversified perspectives. The integration of future urban research will be an iterative process of resolving conflicts; this integration requires a long-term cycle of four main steps, including reaching consensus on basic concepts, revealing the formation mechanism, refining the characteristics of different systems, and integrating the system of systems. In conclusion, the concept of Future Cities explores how the city meets people's needs for a better life. Against the backdrop of the information revolution, it is urgent to discard reductionist thinking, use systems thinking to understand the future city instead, plan and build Future Cities through continuous iterative practice, and realize the sustainable development of mankind.",10.1360/TB-2021-0647,,webofscience
2019,Confederated cloud-Design consideration for distributed utility computing system of systems,"Cloud computing advances are enabling cloud tenants to host and process their IT workloads in a safe, reliable, and cost-effective manner. Federated clouds help cloud providers optimize many business parameters such as computing resource utilization. Federated clouds also introduce business risks to the cloud service providers in situations such as fewer tenants and various misconfigurations of energy, security, and load distributions arising from some possible sources. Yet, the rewards outweigh the risks when the federation implementation is successful. This work proposes a different optimization strategy that clarifies and simplifies the design trade-offs for the federated clouds. We call it the confederated cloud. The strategy for it is to recruit customer groups by providing domain-specific market services to cloud service providers that have a common market or business characteristics. The confederation will be a federation of domain groups, thus forming an interim cloud grouping that will retain domain-specific privacy and governance structure and the confederation structure provide services on a more efficient or cost-effective basis than can individual cloud service providers. This will help cloud providers to increase their datacenter resource utilization, decrease energy consumption, improve security, and increase revenue. It will also support cloud providers to set a suitable computing price for each computing resource type that matches the specific cloud group domain requirements. This solution will enable domain-specific tenant groups to maintain controls of what is competitively vital and pool resources where it is advantageous to do so. The resulting architecture will be a decentralized system of systems that offers multicloud providers deployments similar to the centralized cloud federation. The confederated cloud system of systems described introduces a new system of systems engineering paradigm that uses domain-specific governance for otherwise open communities that collaborate throughout the system life cycle. The confederated cloud system of systems has no explicit requirements for the cloud provider and cloud providers will not be aware of confederation services. Nonetheless, cloud providers might also not be aware of such system of systems. A successful confederated cloud will advantageous for many tenants. This enhanced market for cloud providers will help advance and drive the evolution of federated clouds.",10.1002/sys.21473,,webofscience
2020,Extending the scope of configuration management for the development and life cycle support of systems of systems-An ontology-driven framework applied to the Enceladus Submarine Exploration Lander,"Increasingly complex systems of systems (SoS) have to be developed in ever shorter times-to-market at reduced costs and with high reliability. In addition, as the life cycle of such SoS frequently spans across several decades, customer expectations and market conditions will evolve. Systems engineering (SE)/model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and configuration management (CM) need to be ever more closely integrated to appropriately address this situation. CM as a discipline is essential for establishing traceability and controlling baseline evolutions between all the relevant pieces of information resulting from the related system life cycle processes of all constituent systems of such SoS; but for this to work, the scope of CM must be extended both throughout the entire life cycle and across all participating monolithic systems. New frameworks are needed to effectively and efficiently apply CM across SoS arrangements. This paper proposes an ontology-based, federative approach to managing the inherent complexity of CM in the context of SoS, with particular focus on a change management framework for SoS. Examples from a conceptual system that is concerned with the submarine exploration of Enceladus as part of the Saturn exploration system are used to demonstrate typical SE/MBSE artifacts and how CM needs to address them across the involved operational and enabling systems.",10.1002/sys.21532,,webofscience

2008,Systems of Systems (SoSE) Engineering for the 21(st) century healthcare enterprise,"This paper describes multiple important opportunities for applying System of System Engineering (SoSE) concepts in the 21(st) Century healthcare enterprise. Throughout the world, populations are aging rapidly, which is creating unprecedented economic, social, political, and technical challenges that cannot be solved using past approaches. Healthcare today is terribly wasteful of labor, material, computer, and capital resources, and its high fatigue and error rates cause unacceptable human suffering daily. SoSE methodologies, including incremental modeling, simulation, verification, and validation can help create new healthcare enterprises that are not only more efficient and more humane, but are also more readily adapted to the endless evolution of science, society, and technology, and the equally endless and unpredictable emergent behaviors that all systems inevitably provoke.",,,webofscience
2016,pi-Calculus for SoS: A Foundation for Formally Describing Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems,"A critical issue for the design of a System-of-Systems (SoS) is the formal description of its architecture. One of the complicating factors for formally describing SoS architectures is that they evolve dynamically, during run-time, in unexpected ways. Today, none of the existing process calculi applied for formally describing the architecture of software intensive single systems has the expressive power to formally describe the architecture of software-intensive SoSs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel process calculus, the pi-Calculus for SoS, which was specially conceived for enabling the formal architecture description of software intensive SoSs, meeting their challenging characteristics.",,,webofscience
2013,Modeling of System of Systems via Data Analytics - Case for Big Data in SoS,"Large data has been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for quite some time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of Big Data. System of Systems (SoS) integrate independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today's SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable Big Data. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called Data Analytics, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of Big Data to a manageable size and apply these tools to a) extract information, b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the Big Data. This paper attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. A photovoltaic energy forecasting problem of a micro grid SoS will be offered here for a case study of this modeling relation.",,,webofscience
2007,Capability-based quantitative technology evaluation for systems-of-system,"In this work, a methodology for quantitative technology evaluation for systems-of-systems is defined. Physics-based models of an aircraft system are exercised within a hierarchical, object-oriented constructive simulation to quantify technology potential in the context of a relevant scenario. Neural network surrogate models and agent-based modeling are leveraged to provide a battle management and technology exploitation capabilities to individual assets in the simulation. Surrogate models are also used around the simulation to perform rapid domain-spanning technology exploration. Since a large amount of data is produced in the analysis of systems-of-systems, dynamic, interactive visualization techniques are used to enable what-if games on assumptions, systems, technologies, tactics, and evolving threats to enable decision making with respect to technology investment.",,,webofscience
2010,Constructing Program Management Framework A System of Systems Approach,"Programs are aimed at achieving long term objectives that create value to stakeholders. They consist of a portfolio of projects, each of which aims at achieving specific sub- goals. A program emerges as a system of systems (SoS) when these projects are connected in a systemic way to accomplish program objectives. This entails that programs have an architecture that defines how the various projects interact to accomplish the overall objectives. Current program management approaches, however, largely treat programs as a collection of projects that are managed operationally to optimize outcomes at each level, rather than as a system to be architected. This paper develops a systemic architecture for programs in terms of three interconnected facets: value realization, program construction and program execution, and highlights the role of program worldview in this. Each of these facets brings out some aspects of the way in which projects relate to each other within a program. We propose an iterative framework in which models are developed for addressing each facet, but there is also an overall structure of activity and information flows that facilitates interplay and co- evolution of the models. The result is a holistic approach to managing programs as a system of systems, at a level over and above project management.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482471,,webofscience
2016,System-of-systems support - A bigraph approach to interoperability and emergent behavior,"When designing highly interactive distributed systems such as e-learning environments, a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective enables dynamic adaptation to situations of use and thus user-centeredness during operation. Each system, e.g., a mobile device for accessing a learning management system, can still be operated as a separate system, e.g., displaying the latest feedback from peers, while being run as part of a federated system, e.g., synchronizing a learning group for a tutoring session taking into account individual availability of participants. This type of coupling requires interoperability assurance of systems, in particular federating various devices and cross-over features (e.g., linking learning content to posts on social media platforms) in dynamically evolving environments. We demonstrate the utility of bigraph-based handling of SoS. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the re-specification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We show the potential of this approach orchestrating two distributed and independent systems, with orchestration enabling directly respondence to changes in a federated system's context.

2000,Seeing through the fog - Attaining 'full spectrum dominance' with the system-of-systems through operational engineering,"Many discussions and articles address the business and military changes supporting implementation of Joint Vision 2010 and its system-of-systems approach. The dynamics of international military operations and commitments, coupled with accelerating information technologies, can lead to confusion and uncertainty Customary rules recommend caution, even stopping, when confusion and uncertainty are present, yet the needed changes counsel toward accelerated efforts. Currently, systems engineering does not completely address delivering operational war fighting capabilities, or foster commanders' confidence to fully exploit those capabilities upon delivery. Acquisition reform supports accelerating delivery of systems. likewise, accelerated delivery of war fighting capabilities within any opponents' fielding and deployment cycle is imperative. Technical advances in modeling and simulation, utilization concepts, and innovative evaluation methods create an opportunity to facilitate codevelopment of doctrine, operations, and training prior to producing hardware systems. On-line simulation and evaluation tools can overcome the need for physical systems. Specifically, this paper lays out the opportunity to evolve systems engineering to another level, operational engineering, which leverages from the modeling and simulation environment, prior to hardware production. That modeling and simulation paired with coevolution of procedures and on-line analysis will produce a trained customer base, fully prepared for deliveries of operational war fighting capabilities.",10.1111/j.1559-3584.2000.tb03322.x,,webofscience
2009,Systems Approach to Complex Joint-part Management,"Joint-part between and among monolithic systems, known as the accident black spot in management, is vital to the overall optimization of performance, cost and risk. The traits of joint-part both as a system and as a system of systems are described. The origin of complexity in joint-part management is discussed The WSR methodology, an oriental methodology proposed by Professor Gu Ji-fa during his cooperation project about systems engineering in the Center for Systems Studies of the University of Hull, UK, in 1994, is introduced for joint-part analysis. In order to accommodate the traits of joint-part, it is proposed that the joint-part should be treated as system of systems rather than monolithic system, and it can only be engineered by intervention and evolution, not by specification and then development. Joint-part management is to ensure appropriate interaction, evolution, and emergence. Therefore, the joint-part management matrix, with its top row listing Wu-li Shi-li and Ren-li, and its first column listing interaction, evolution and emergence, is created. Finally, an empirical analysis on joint-part management is presented to prove the feasibility of the approach claimed in this paper.",,,webofscience
2021,Design considerations introducing analytics as a dual use in complex industrial embedded systems,"Embedded systems are today often self-sufficient with limited and predefined communication. However, this traditional view of embedded systems is changing through advancements in technologies such as, communication, cloud technologies, and advanced analytics including machine learning. These advancements have increased the benefits of building Systems of Systems (SoS) that can provide a functionality with unique capabilities that none of the included subsystems can accomplish separately. By this gain of functionality the embedded system is evolving towards a dual use purpose(1). The use is dual in the sense that the system still needs to handle its original task, e.g., control and protect of an asset, and it must provide information for creating the SoS. Larger installations, e.g., industry plants, power systems and generation, have in most cases a long expected life-cycle, some up to 30-40 years without significant updates, compared to analytical functions that evolve and change much faster, i.e., requiring new types of data sets from the subsystems, not know at its first deployment. This difference in development cycles calls for new solutions supporting updates related to new requirements inherent in analytical functions. In this paper, within the context of dual usage of systems and subsystems, we analyze the impact on an embedded system, new or legacy, when it is required to provide analytic data with high quality. We compare a reference system, implementing all functions in one CPU core, to three other alternative solutions: a) a multi-core system where we are using a separate core for analytics, b) using a separate analytics CPU and c) analytics functionality located in a separate subsystem. Our conclusion is that the choice of analytics information collection method should to be based on intended usage, along with resulting complexity and cost of updates compared to hardware cost.",10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613273,,webofscience
2006,Simultaneous overpass off nadir (SOON): A method for unified CalibrationNalidation across IEOS and GEOSS system of systems,"The US operates a diverse, evolving constellation of research and operational environmental satellites, principally in polar and geosynchronous orbits. Our current and enhanced future domestic remote sensing capability is complemented by the significant capabilities of our current and potential future international partners. Satellite data users, such as the JSCSDA, are following roadmaps for the relentlessly increased ingest and assimilation of these data feeds, driven by the desire to fulfill the evolving operational requirements of their respective end-user communities. In this analysis, we define success through the data customers' eyes: participating in the sufficient and continuously improving satisfaction of their mission responsibilities. To successfully fuse together observations from multiple simultaneous platforms and sensors into a common, self-consistent, operational environment requires that there exist a unified calibration and validation approach. Here, we consider develop a concept for an integrating framework for absolute accuracy; long-term stability; self-consistency among sensors, platforms, techniques, and observing systems; and validation and characterization of performance. Across all systems, this is a non-trivial problem. NOAA alone sustains > 80 observing platforms, > 800 variables, and > 30K observing data collection points. Simultaneous Nadir Overpasses, or SNO's, provide a proven intercomparison technique: simultaneous, collocated, co-angular measurements. Many systems have off-nadir elements, or effects, that must be calibrated. For these systems, the nadir technique constrains the process. We define the term SOON, for simultaneous overpass off nadir. We present a target architecture and sensitivity analysis for the affordable, sustainable implementation of a global SOON calibration/validation network that can deliver the much-needed comprehensive, common, self-consistent operational picture in near-real time, at an affordable cost.",10.1117/12.682890,,webofscience

With a heritage of developing and integrating science instruments on space platforms and airborne systems, NGC is conducting analysis of alternatives for a global observing system that integrates data collected from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites with Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) platforms. This enhanced acquisition of environmental data will feed decision support systems such as the TouchTable (R) to deliver improved decision making capabilities. Rapidly fusing and displaying multiple types of weather and ocean observations, imagery, and environmental data with geospatial data to create an integrated source of information for end users such as emergency managers and planners will deliver innovative solutions to improve disaster warning, mitigate disaster impacts, and reduce the loss of life and property. We present analysis of alternatives of combinations of sensor platforms that integrate space and airborne systems with ground and ocean observing sensors and form the basis for vertically integrated global observing systems with the capacity to improve measurements associated with hazard and climate-related uncertainties. The analyses include candidate sensors deployed on various configurations of satellites that include NPOESS, GOES R, and future configurations, augmented by UAS vehicles including Global Hawk, configured to deliver innovative environmental data collection capabilities over a range of environmental conditions, including severe hazards, such as hurricanes and extreme wildland fires.

2022,Hetero-functional network minimum cost flow optimization: A hydrogen-natural gas network example,"Sustainable energy grids and networks are converging. In recent decades, cost, sustainability, and digitization drivers have caused engineering systems to evolve into systems-of-systems that deliver multiple services across multiple application domains. These engineering systems include electrified transportation systems, the energy-water nexus, and multi-modal energy systems. The rather complex and heterogeneous interdependencies between engineering system services necessitates a precise informatic representation that ultimately supports optimized management of the holistic dynamics and tradeoffs. Consequently, ontologically-robust, quantitative modeling tools are needed to represent the heterogeneity of the modeled system-of-systems while still remaining generic and extensible to a diversity of application domains. Hetero-functional graph theory has demonstrated itself as a such modeling tool. This work now builds upon this foundation to develop a dynamic hetero-functional network minimum cost flow optimization that meets the requirements of these emerging systems of-systems. It optimizes the supply, demand, transportation, storage, transformation, assembly, and disassembly of multiple operands in distinct locations over time in a systems-of-systems of arbitrary number, function, and topology. First, the paper introduces a general approach to define a dynamic system-of-system model that integrates customizable dynamic device models into a hetero-functional graph theory structural model. To this end, the work leverages Petri net dynamics and the heterofunctional incidence tensor. The Petri net based models are then translated into a quadratic program in canonical form. The hetero-functional network minimum cost flow optimization is demonstrated on a hydrogen-natural gas infrastructure test case. Four distinct scenarios are studied to demonstrate potential synergies and cascading network effects of policy across multiple infrastructures.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100749,,webofscience
2023,Fine-Grained Prediction and Control of Covid-19 Pandemic in a City: Application to Post-Initial Stages,"Predicting the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic during its early phases was relatively easy as its dynamics were governed by few influencing factors that included a single dominant virus variant and the demographic characteristics of a given area. Several models based on a wide variety of techniques were developed for this purpose. Their prediction accuracy started deteriorating as the number of influencing factors and their interrelationships grew over time. With the pandemic evolving in a highly heterogeneous way across individual countries, states, and even individual cities, there emerged a need for a contextual and fine-grained understanding of the pandemic to come up with effective means of pandemic control. This paper presents a fine-grained model for predicting and controlling Covid-19 in a large city. Our approach borrows ideas from complex adaptive system-of-systems paradigm and adopts a concept of agent as the core modeling abstraction.",10.1007/978-3-031-21203-1_19,,webofscience
1998,Space-Based Infrared Satellite System (SBIRS) requirements management,"The Space-Based Infrared Satellite System (SBIRS) is the follow-on to the Defense Support Program (DSP). DSP and SBIRS are military space programs. DSP provides a highly available, survivable, and reliable satellite-borne surveillance system which detects and reports missile launches, space launches, nuclear detonations, and other events in near-real-time during pre-, trans-, and post-attack operations. SEIRS will provide improved missile warning for attacks against North America and the rest of the world. SEIRS will also provide surveillance support to national and theater missile defense, technical intelligence, and battlespace characterization. The SBIRS system of systems is being implemented in a phased approach. The first phase, Increment 1, consolidates ground processing of DSP data in the U.S. Increment 2 launches the improved replacement satellites in geosynchronous and Molniya orbits. Increment 3, not yet on contract, adds a satellite constellation in low earth orbit. The requirements for the SBIRS system have evolved considerably from the DSP requirements. This evolution originated with a Department of Defense-wide study performed in the summer of 1994 that evaluated the requirements, system architecture, and cost for the future space-based missile warning system. It was decided in this study to consolidate the missile warning, missile defense, technical intelligence, and battlespace characterization missions. The requirements for the evolutionary system were captured in a Capstone Requirements Document. The acquisition approach to implement the High Component first, then the Low Component (High Now, Low Later) was also established in the 1994 Summer Study. Subsequent to the summer of 1994, the SBIRS mission requirements have been significantly refined. The current mission requirements are documented in an Operational Requirements Document (ORD) which is maintained by the Air Force organization that operates the DSP and SBIRS systems, Air Force Space Command. The mission requirements in the ORD have been allocated to the High and Low Components via a Requirements Allocation Document (RAD) maintained by the SBIRS System of Systems Engineering contractor, Lockheed -Martin. The RAD flows ORD requirements into minimum system specifications for the High and Low Component Systems. The SBIRS missions have different levels of maturity: missile warning and technical intelligence are the most mature; missile defense is evolving as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization establishes the National Missile Defense and the Theater Missile Defense Programs; the battlespace characterization mission requirements are not completely defined. Some Users are refining their mission requirements in parallel with the SBIRS engineering and manufacturing developments. The process to change requirements is a disciplined process which follows the new defense acquisition policy to use cost as an independent variable. All of the approved SEIRS requirements must be shown to have affordable implementation in hardware and software. This paper describes the process used to validate and incorporate new or modified requirements into the SBIRS baseline. It also describes the process for requirements refinement over the course of the development, the trades associated with mission utility and cost, and the government approval process.",,,webofscience
2016,From Data to Processes-Use of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare,"Widespread adoption of HealthIT and eHealth systems has resulted in exponential growth of health related data that can be computationally processed and analyzed. Many healthcare organizations are adopting computational data analysis techniques and integrating results into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems for improving care delivery. However, data analysis alone cannot give insight into healthcare systems that are rapidly evolving into complex and dynamic system of systems. Every data is produced and/or consumed by an underlying process. Thus, to improve healthcare from the perspective of cost and patient safety, we also need approaches for modeling and analyzing possibly concurrent processes with constraints on resources and exhibiting synchronous and asynchronous interactions. This paper focuses on the use of Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) for healthcare process modeling and analysis.",,,webofscience
2019,Planning for Change in the Flectric Power Industry A Primer for Transactive Energy Scenario Development,"The electric power industry and its associated infrastructures (a.k.a. the grid) are evolving from centrally planned, organized, and operated networks of players, technologies, and resources to systems of systems that are increasingly digitized and distributed in their operation and innovative capacity. Subsequently, strategic planners and technology managers associated with the electric power industry are faced with a range of scenarios to evaluate, including one that considers the emergence of commercialized transactive energy systems in the coming ten-year time horizon. The crafting of a transactive energy scenario can help inform technology innovation and management efforts that benefit consumers, electricity providers, and society by providing planners with a tool to investigate key drivers of change and a range of desired attributes of future technologies that could be employed to address emerging customer needs, wants, and expectations.

To have advantage over these adversaries, new weapon system designs and development should be modular to operate as system-of-systems and should have short development cycles. This requires validated high performance computational models within this modular framework and the need to effectively utilize the High Performance Computing (HPC) resources of many Army initiatives. In this paper we present a new and advanced HPC based rigid and flexible modeling and simulation technology capable of adaptive high/low fidelity modeling that is useful in the initial design concept stage to intermediate stages and to the final design stage in a single seamless simulation environment.

2022,Towards a Software Development Framework for Interconnected Science Ecosystems,"The innovative science of the future must be multi-domain and interconnected to usher in the next generation of self-driving laboratories enabling consequential discoveries and transformative inventions. Such a disparate and interconnected ecosystem of scientific instruments will need to evolve using a system-of-systems (SoS) approach. The key to enabling application integration with such an SoS will be the use of Software Development Kits (SDKs). Currently, SDKs facilitate scientific research breakthroughs via algorithmic automation, databases and storage, optimization and structure, pervasive environmental monitoring, among others. However, existing SDKs lack instrument-interoperability and reusability capabilities, do not effectively work in an open federated architectural environment, and are largely isolated within silos of the respective scientific disciplines. Inspired by the scalable SoS framework, this work proposes the development of INTERSECT-SDK to provide a coherent environment for multi-domain scientific applications to benefit from the open federated architecture in an interconnected ecosystem of instruments. This approach will decompose functionality into loosely coupled software services for interoperability among several solutions that do not scale beyond a single domain and/or application. Furthermore, the proposed environment will allow operational and managerial inter-dependence while providing opportunities for the researchers to reuse software components from other domains and build universal solution libraries. We demonstrate this research for microscopy use-case, where we show how INTERSECT-SDK is developing the tools necessary to enable advanced scanning methods and accelerate scientific discovery.",10.1007/978-3-031-23606-8_13,,webofscience
2021,Collaborative Cyber-Physical Microservices Platform - the SITL-IoT Case,"Managing heterogeneous software and hardware artifacts from multiple suppliers is a complex and challenging process. The integration of sensors, actuators, and their controllers, modeled as IoT elements, also presents significant challenges. Typically, a vendor supplies one or more parts, each one with its proprietary interface, which may raise vendor lock-in and supplier dependencies that can compromise the replacement of some of the artifacts by equivalent ones from competing vendors. The research presented in this paper addresses such challenges in the context of the SITL-IoT project aiming at transforming an industrial agri-food environment towards an open, integrated system-of-systems. We present and discuss a reference implementation of a collaborative platform to simplify the management of different artifacts, supplied by alternative suppliers, modeled as services. More specifically, the concepts of ISystem (Informatic System), CES (Cooperation Enabled Service), and Service are used to manage the different elements that compose an agri-food environment transparently and uniformly.

2018,Adaptation to extreme weather events in complex health and social care systems: The example of older people's services in England,"Our findings contribute to a growing international literature on how conceptual models from complexity theory may be relevant to inform planning in health and social care systems, helping to adapt and improve preparedness and resilience to extreme weather events. We focus on findings from two case studies in England and their relationship to national policy for adaptation. Complexity theory helped to frame strategies for planning for events that are emergent and unpredictable. We find from our case studies that, in spite of the uncertainty involved, some principles' derived from parts of the literature on complexity theory may provide a helpful framework for the development of more robust preparedness strategies in the health and social care sector. By viewing health and social care as a system of systems', adaptation planning recognises the interrelationships of built, institutional and social infrastructures. The idea of local systems, with variable, path-dependent attributes, which are partially closed, but permeable to other parts of the wider network, leads to an actionable model of adaptation which emphasises the potential value of local self-organisation, but also underlines the importance of co-evolution across the wider system and the vital role of national initiatives and support for adaptation strategies. The value of sharing experience from local case studies across the national system, as well as among local partners, is very apparent in the experience reported here.",10.1177/2399654417695101,,webofscience
2001,COTS middleware for real-time distributed interactive simulations - Fact or fiction?,"Current and planned real-time distributed interactive simulation systems must collaborate with many event sources, provide interactive response to human operators, and respond flexibly to unanticipated factors arising at run-time. Moreover, large-scale federated simulation systems, must run largely autonomously, shielding operators from. unnecessary details, while simultaneously communicating and responding to events at an accelerated operational tempo. In next-generation simulation systems of systems it will be hard to predict or even approximate system configurations or workload mixes a priori. While it is possible in theory to develop complex real-time distributed interactive simulation systems from scratch, contemporary economic and organizational constraints, as well as increasingly complex requirements, are making it implausible to do so in practice. Thus, the role played by commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software has become increasingly significant. In its formative years, COTS middleware, such as CORBA, was generally unsuited for real-time distributed interactive simulation systems due to its lack of 1. Standard QoS interfaces in standard specifications 2. QoS enforcement mechanisms 3. Real-time programming features and 4. Optimizations for efficiency, predictability, and dependability. However, the current generation of middleware specifications and implementations provide much better QoS support for real-time distributed interactive simulation systems. This talk describes how the evolution of middleware capabilities, particularly the OMG Real-time CORBA standardization effort and the DMSO HLA/RTI, and the maturation of COTS middleware implementations make it increasingly well-suited as the infrastructure for real-time distributed interactive simulation systems. The material in this talk is based on experience gained with the TAO Real-time CORBA ORB and the SAIC implementation of the HLA/RTZ, which is based on TAO.",10.1109/DISTRA.2001.946443,,webofscience
2019,The cultural paradigm in the smart development of slow cities,"In an age of change, such as ours, the models of interpretation of social and environmental processes need reflection, taking into account the holistic approach and the systemic logic, it is necessary to evaluate the differences between the cities concerning the factors of size, demographic and social context, resources, memory and landscape, synthesizing one's own cultural heritage. The three social, cultural and technological aspects added to the human factor will be the founding base of new territorial management policies aimed at creating inclusive and eco-sustainable cities. If we mean by City as a System of Systems (living, mobility, services, culture, energy, safety, environment, ...) smartness develops in terms of interaction network through research projects and initiatives. The interaction, the relationship between man and space according to Heidegger is nothing but the living thought in its essence; in seeing the city as a set of places and not places and assessing the quality of life through the ways of living in the city, in the construction of a possible scenario, in the redefinition of models, the actions to trigger new processes of smartness able to indicate trajectories of evolution to reduce urban entropy and restore social capital, are developed in continual palimpsests of identity and relationships. Based on of these premises the Slow City can represent a possibility in a perspective of a new humanism of being and living in order to make use of the heritage in an inventive and sustainable approach.",,,webofscience
2022,A model-driven approach to machine learning and software modeling for the IoT Generating full source code for smart Internet of Things (IoT) services and cyber-physical systems (CPS),"Models are used in both Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). SE models may specify the architecture at different levels of abstraction and for addressing different concerns at various stages of the software development life-cycle, from early conceptualization and design, to verification, implementation, testing and evolution. However, AI models may provide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision-making support. For instance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is currently the most popular sub-discipline of AI, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the observed data and can become capable of making predictions. The goal of this work is to create synergy by bringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic approach to model-driven software development for intelligent systems that require ML. We illustrate how software models can become capable of creating and dealing with ML models in a seamless manner. The main focus is on the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where both ML and model-driven SE play a key role. In the context of the need to take a Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems perspective of the targeted architecture, an integrated design environment for both SE and ML sub-systems would best support the optimization and overall efficiency of the implementation of the resulting system. In particular, we implement the proposed approach, called ML-Quadrat, based on ThingML, and validate it using a case study from the IoT domain, as well as through an empirical user evaluation.

Integration of Internet Protocol (IP) capabilities allowing for node addressing, data transfer, and communications between systems once considered only Electronic Warfare (EW)-centric, may provide nation-state and non-nation-state adversaries and opportunistic malicious hackers the ability to exploit systems previously considered autonomous. Furthermore, network operations can be affected from wireless and remotely-operating RF systems associated to, or trusted with, operational networks. Basic RF jamming techniques provide an adversary the ability to affect blue force IP over radio communications and data transmissions with little or no risk to themselves by obfuscating their efforts as an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer 2-6 attack rather than a layer 1 attack. The Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC) Vulnerability Assessment Team (JVAT) performs adversarial red team tactics against developmental Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs), to include CNE/CNA and RF system of systems. The evolution of 'smart' weapons technologies, to include most information operations (IO) capabilities, now represents the norm in systems development. Command and control (C-2) and common operational pictures (COPs) with integrated IP over radio, provide multiple attack vectors and unique opportunities for adversaries. Organizations that manage and develop EW and/or wireless networks must adapt policies and organizational processes to meet the changing environment and to deal with an increasingly savvy adversary who only requires open-source tools and technologies to successfully attack sophisticated RF networked systems. In this paper the authors identify adversarial tactics used against developmental systems with integrated EW and CNO capabilities; using only open-source and publically available equipment, data, and technologies. The authors will also discuss adversarial techniques from three case studies based on actual red teaming assessments on developmental systems.",,,webofscience
2004,Search for organising principles: understanding in systems biology,"Due in large measure to the explosive progress in molecular biology, biology has become arguably the most exciting scientific field. The first half of the 21st century is sometimes referred to as the 'era of biology', analogous to thefirst half of the 20th century, which was considered to be the 'era of physics'. Yet, biology is facing a crisis - or is it an opportunity - reminiscent ofthe state of biology in pre-double-helix time. The principal challenge facingsystems biology is complexity. According to Hood, 'Systems biology defines and analyses the interrelationships of all of the elements in a functioning system in order to understand how the system works.' With 30000+ genes in the human genome the study of all relationships simultaneously becomes a formidably complex problem. Hanahan and Weinberg raised the question as to whether progresswill consist of 'adding further layers of complexity to a scientific literature that is already complex almost beyond measure' or whether the progress willlead to a 'science with a conceptual structure and logical coherence that rivals that of chemistry or physics.' At the core of the challenge is the need for a new approach, a shift from reductionism to a holistic perspective. However, more than just a pronouncement of a new approach is needed. We suggest that what is needed is to provide a conceptual framework for systems biology research. We propose that the concept of a complex system, i.e. a system of systems as defined in mathematical general systems theory (MGST), is central to provide such a framework. We further argue that for a deeper understanding in systems biology investigations should go beyond building numerical mathematical or computer models - important as they are. Biological phenomena cannot be predicted with the level of numerical precision as in classical physics. Explanationsin terms of how the categories of systems are organised to function in ever changing conditions are more revealing. Non-numerical mathematical tools are appropriate for the task. Such a categorical perspective led us to propose that the core of understanding in systems biology depends on the search for organising principles rather than solely on construction of predictive descriptions (i.e. models) that exactly outline the evolution of systems in space and time. The search for organising principles requires an identification/discovery of new concepts and hypotheses. Some of them, such as coordination motifs for transcriptional regulatory networks and bounded autonomy of levccels in a hierarchy, are outlined in this article. Experimental designs are outlined to help verify the applicability of the interaction balance principle of coordination to transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks.",,,webofscience
2018,EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM OF THE BARCELONA WORLD RACE 2007-2019,"This paper describes the main characteristics and evolution of the first 10 years of the application of the Educational Program (EP) of the Barcelona World Race (BWR). This is an unprecedented initiative in the methodology of project-based learning, and is the result of combining the goals of the official curriculum of primary and secondary education with the contents of a large-scale sporting event. The BWR is a round-the-world sailing regatta that covers 45,000 km in a roundtrip from Barcelona, without stopovers or assistance, with two crew on board. The regatta is organized by the Barcelona Foundation for Ocean Sailing (FNOB) and, since its first edition in 2007-08, it considered taking advantage of the potential of a round- the-world regatta as an innovative training medium. Since then there have been three editions of the regatta and EP, and a fourth edition is being put together for the beginning of 2019, which will include a port of call in Sydney. The original design of the EP is based on four basic approaches. Firstly, it has a broad perspective as it deals with all types of content and training competences grouped into three main points; the environment, technology/sailing, and a human dimension. Second, it uses the concept of an oceanic sailboat as an eco-friendly machine, a clean vehicle that can circumnavigate the globe with zero emissions into the atmosphere. In the EP the sailboat is seen as an autonomous system of systems in which many aspects of life and training topics of educational value are encountered, such as: coexistence, personal improvement, nutrition, physical preparation, knowledge of the environment, geography, new materials, mechanics, physics, mathematics, communications, sustainability, etc. A third element is the role it gives to new technologies and their use in education. Finally, a key component of the program is the trip: the adventure of following an extreme sporting event, in real time, from the classroom, during a period that can range from a few weeks to the whole school year. From these principles the FNOB, in collaboration with the University of Barcelona and the Consorci el Far, developed in 2007 a first catalogue of training materials that allowed students and teachers from primary and secondary schools to work on, in person and online, the contents of the curriculum applied to situations and challenges that arose during the race. In the subsequent editions of the BWR these training resources have evolved to set up a specific online platform that facilitates collaborative learning among different schools that have to face the same challenges during the course of the race. The EP of the BWR has been developed in several languages, is free and open to the educational community. In the three editions held there has been a close follow-up of 50,000 students distributed in several hundreds of class-groups in various schools. The presentation will show the results of the follow-up, the high evaluation from the participants, and the changes foreseen for the fourth edition. As a final reflection, the training potential of this methodology applied to other similar sporting events will be considered.",,,webofscience

2008,… of net centric system of systems using systems modeling language and colored Petri‐nets: A demonstration using the global earth observation system of systems,"Understanding the operations of a large ‘‘net-centric system-of-systems’’ requires in-depth knowledge of the interfaces and the interactions among the various systems, subsystems, and components. Architectural modeling can help in reducing the complexity involved in designing large networked systems. This paper demonstrates a modeling approach for network centric systems. An example of such a complex system is the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)— a system for monitoring and collecting information related to Earth's resources. The GEOSS is an evolving complex network centric system. The modeling of the GEOSS has been demonstrated using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). In this paper, architecture representation using SysML demonstrates an object-oriented approach of model development. This paper discusses issues related to architecture description, development, presentation, and integration for the chosen domain. This paper also highlights some of the differences between SysML, which is used to model a wide range of systems, and Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is primarily used to model information systems only. Finally, in order to synthesize an executable model from the static views developed using SysML, Colored Petri-nets (CP-nets) have been used. The executable model, constructed using CP nets, is used to validate the architecture against the static model. Overall, this research defines a methodology to model and simulate complex network centric system of systems in order to understand and simulate their behavior using a scenario based approach. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2013,Verification and Validation Issues in Systems of Systems,"
Abstract:  The cutting edge in systems development today is in the area of ""systems of
systems"" (SoS) large networks of inter-related systems that are developed and
managed separately, but that also perform collective activities. Such large
systems typically involve constituent systems operating with different life
cycles, often with uncoordinated evolution. The result is an ever-changing SoS
in which adaptation and evolution replace the older engineering paradigm of
""development"". This short paper presents key thoughts about verification and
validation in this environment. Classic verification and validation methods
rely on having (a) a basis of proof, in requirements and in operational
scenarios, and (b) a known system configuration to be proven. However, with
constant SoS evolution, management of both requirements and system
configurations are problematic. Often, it is impossible to maintain a valid set
of requirements for the SoS due to the ongoing changes in the constituent
systems. Frequently, it is even difficult to maintain a vision of the SoS
operational use as users find new ways to adapt the SoS. These features of the
SoS result in significant challenges for system proof. In addition to
discussing the issues, the paper also indicates some of the solutions that are
currently used to prove the SoS.

ULS systems will necessarily be decentralized in a variety of ways, developed and used by a wide variety of stakeholders with conflicting needs, evolving continuously, and constructed from heterogeneous parts. People will not just be users of a ULS system they will be elements of the system. Software and hardware failures will be the norm rather than the exception. The acquisition of a ULS system will be simultaneous with its operation and will require new methods for control. These characteristics are beginning to emerge in today s DoD systems of systems in ULS systems they will dominate.

2019,Towards intelligent architecting of aerospace system-of-systems,"System-of-Systems (SoS) are composed of large scale independent and complex heterogeneous systems which collaborate to create capabilities not achievable by a single system, for example air transportation system, satellite constellations, and space exploration architectures. Much of the research effort in the field of SoS has focused on the analysis of these complex entities, while there are still major gaps in developing tools for automated synthesis and engineering of SoS that consider all the various aspects in this problem domain. The gap we address in this paper is a mapping of clusters of SoS architecture alternatives, segmented by performance along multiple metrics, to architectural features. Building upon our previous research where we used a SoS Analytic Work Bench in combination with Model-Based Systems Engineering artifacts to perform analysis of aerospace systems, we propose to build a process for intelligent architecting of aerospace SoS. This process discovers and employs pertinent features in a complex design space to effectively meet the user needs, elevating SoS engineering from retrospective architectural analysis to automated synthesis of new architectures. As a first step towards intelligent architecture of aerospace SoS, we propose to utilize Machine Learning techniques to automate the synthesis phase of SoS. Our hypothesis is that a set of holistic metrics of aerospace architectures (cost, performance, robustness, operational risk, average delay, etc.) can be used to characterize a measure of goodness of architectures, with good architectures on a Pareto front of the multi-dimensional space of holistic metrics of interest. Each architecture or cluster may be then mapped to a set of architectural features, with the goal of identifying which features belong to good architectures. Specifically, we propose to utilize non-parametric regression on a set of training architectures (for example, Neural Networks can deal with mixed real and integer variables) to associate each one with a pattern of features. This mapping will allow the automated process to predict what metrics will be expected from SoS architectures with specific features, and therefore to automatically synthesize architectures that exhibit desired characteristics of goodness. For example, for constellations of satellites, a group of good architecture might have medium cost, high resilience, medium robustness, and low risk, and the architectural features to be mapped to each group can include number of satellites, number of components, type of orbit, type of power system, etc. Since the environment constantly evolves, architectures must adapt, and stochastic optimization can be used to switch between architectures with minimal effort. In this work we illustrate the new version of our aerospace SoS analysis and synthesis framework, which includes Machine Learning techniques to support synthesis of SoS architectures. We demonstrate the application of this process on satellite constellations and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8742173/,googlescholar

As systems become increasingly complex, modularity becomes the key to reuse, scalability, and an open architecture. In addition, these design features are key to a manageable and affordable transformation from current to future capabilities across acquisition maturity phases over several decades of fielding. A new large-scale SoS cannot be built in isolation. It needs to evolve internally and accommodate external pressures to integrate or be interoperable with current systems of record. The development of a unifying ontology that spans multiple domains in the SoS is shown to be crucial, if not pivotal, to the success of SoS engineering efforts which are inherently multi-disciplinary and collaborative.",,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA463386,googlescholar

In this context, the AMADEOS European project is bringing together researchers and practitioners to provide the support to design SoS starting from the definition of a domain specific ontology serving as a vocabulary for SoS. Our contribution consists in the modeling of the key SoS concepts and relationships defined in AMADEOS adopting a systems modeling language visual modeling language.

2016,System-of-systems support—A bigraph approach to interoperability and emergent behavior,"
                  When designing highly interactive distributed systems such as e-learning environments, a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective enables dynamic adaptation to situations of use and thus user-centeredness during operation. Each system, e.g., a mobile device for accessing a learning management system, can still be operated as a separate system, e.g., displaying the latest feedback from peers, while being run as part of a federated system, e.g., synchronizing a learning group for a tutoring session taking into account individual availability of participants. This type of coupling requires interoperability assurance of systems, in particular federating various devices and cross-over features (e.g., linking learning content to posts on social media platforms) in dynamically evolving environments. We demonstrate the utility of bigraph-based handling of SoS. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the re-specification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We show the potential of this approach orchestrating two distributed and independent systems, with orchestration enabling directly respondence to changes in a federated system's context.

This paper discusses the design of digital systems in a user-centered way with the help of subject-oriented design. The approach follows a communication-driven and network-centric perspective on a System-of-Systems, whereby system specifications encapsulate behavior and exchange messages, including relevant data, such as business objects. Systems can represent activities of human actors, as well as artefacts. Stakeholders can be actively involved in their roles in the design of a System-of-Systems. In the course of design, they identify and refine role-specific behavior, based on communication to other actors or systems. A System-of-Systems specification evolves as a network of cooperating behavior entities. It develops according to communication needs and system-specific capabilities, on the level of synchronized execution agents, or as an overlay mechanism on existing applications or sub networks. Since certain behavior sequences, such as decision-making procedures, are re-occurring in organizations or eco-systems, the design of complex systems can be facilitated by behavior patterns stemming from existing modeling experiences.",,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/5/1/3,googlescholar

2013,System-of-systems complexity,"
Abstract:  The global availability of communication services makes it possible to
interconnect independently developed systems, called constituent systems, to
provide new synergistic services and more efficient economic processes. The
characteristics of these new Systems-of-Systems are qualitatively different
from the classic monolithic systems. In the first part of this presentation we
elaborate on these differences, particularly with respect to the autonomy of
the constituent systems, to dependability, continuous evolution, and emergence.
In the second part we look at a SoS from the point of view of cognitive
complexity. Cognitive complexity is seen as a relation between a model of an
SoS and the observer. In order to understand the behavior of a large SoS we
have to generate models of adequate simplicity, i.e, of a cognitive complexity
that can be handled by the limited capabilities of the human mind. We will
discuss the importance of properly specifying and placing the relied-upon
message interfaces between the constituent systems that form an open SoS and
discuss simplification strategies that help to reduce the cognitive complexity.

2014,System of Systems and Big Data analytics–Bridging the gap,"
                  Large data has been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for quite some time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data”. System of Systems (SoS) integrate independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today’s SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable “Big Data”. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation (such as genetic algorithms), Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to (a) extract information, (b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and (c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”. This paper demonstrates how to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. The subject material for this demonstration is using data analytics to generate a model to forecast produced photovoltaic energy to assist in the optimization of a micro grid SoS. Tools like fuzzy interference, neural networks, PCA, and genetic algorithms are used.

2006,System of systems (SoS) engineering &architecture challenges in a net centric environment,"As the DOD moves through the brave new world of transformation in a NetCentric environment, the importance of understanding how system engineering needs to evolve to embrace this environment becomes more urgent. System of systems (SoS) in an environment dominated by applying NetCentric principles and influenced by our customers would, by its very nature, require us to redefine how we apply system engineering. This paper presents observations on what would influence and define the evolution of system engineering into the SoS environment. It highlights new competencies that would be needed in order to leverage SoS. Experimentation would be a key enabler to realize the impacts of SoS in order to understand its inherent emergent properties. What does this mean for classical system engineering as we know it today and SE of a SoS be that much different than SE for the systems?

2019,Risk-informed decision-making in asset management as a complex adaptive system of systems,"Decision-making is an essential activity in asset management (AM). It is influenced by various factors (strategic, technical/technological, economic, organisational, regulatory, safety, markets, etc.). Sound decision-making in AM ought to take into account relevant factors in order to balance risks, opportunities, performance, costs and benefits. Additionally, modern organisations evolve in complex operational and business environments and are exposed to significant uncertainties. In such a context, decision-making in AM becomes more challenging. This study proposes a holistic three-step risk-informed decision-making (RIDM) methodology developed for AM, where RIDM is considered a complex adaptive system of systems. The methodology is applied in a case study to analyse possible modification strategies for a nuclear power plant's emergency core cooling system. Through the RIDM process, quantitative models and other factors have been taken into account in order to obtain the necessary comprehensive insights regarding the decision to be made.",10.1504/IJSEAM.2019.108468,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJSEAM.2019.108468,googlescholar

On the other hand, distributed generation has made its mark in the power distribution system, as a consequence of economic and environmental considerations. With the exponential advancement of technology, unconventional sources of generation, storage and microturbines have been enhanced. The microgrid has paved its way into distributed generation and looks promising for future prospects. A review of microgrid architectures and models is presented in this study. Various control schemes devised for microgrids are also reviewed. The concept of SoSs is introduced and its applications are discussed. A framework is proposed for microgrids from an SoS perspective and control paradigms based on SoS are explained in terms of microgrid control.",10.1049/iet-rpg.2014.0171,https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1049/iet-rpg.2014.0171,googlescholar

2016,Longevity in a sustainable human factors and ergonomics system-of-systems,"Human expansion and behaviour across the world has begun to seriously erode the carrying capacity of many natural systems. There are now major concerns about resource depletion and degradation, irreparable damage to natural cycles, and massive asymmetries in access to resources for many populations. The term "" sustainability "" encapsulates our attempts to try and ameliorate or cope with these negative affects. Within the human factors and ergonomics field concepts such as ergoecology, green ergonomics, and human factors for sustainable development have been introduced to help us focus our attention on these pressing, but complex issues. In attempting to synthesise the work on sustainability and to provide a framework for future work in HFE, Thatcher and Yeow (2016a; 2016b) introduced a sustainable HFE system-of-systems model that represents HFE systems in a hierarchy from simple HFE systems (e.g. tasks), towards increasing layers of complexity and scope (e.g. jobs, teams, organisations, and society). The model shows how "" parent "" (larger more complex) and "" child "" (smaller and less complex) systems might be ordered and connected. Starting from the premise that no system is sustainable forever, this paper looks at the implications of this model for how long a particular system should last and what happens to the system-of-systems if a specific system terminates prematurely or persists too long. Next, this paper looks at the natural evolution of systems over time, in what Gunderson and Holling (2002) have called adaptive cycles. Finally, the paper concludes with a specific caution about how humans are cognitively unable to deal with the complexities of time (i.e. temporal discounting). The revised model is presented in the conclusion to this paper.",,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Thatcher/publication/309606212_Longevity_in_a_sustainable_human_factors_and_ergonomics_system-of-systems/links/58194eb308ae1f34d24ac505/Longevity-in-a-sustainable-human-factors-and-ergonomics-system-of-systems.pdf,googlescholar

2010,"Lean and agile acquisition and systems engineering, a paradigm whose time has come","Todays U.S. Department of Defense acquisition system is faced with historically unprecedented and seemingly insurmountable challenges that are leading to cost and schedule overruns, poor technical performance, reduced delivery order quantities, and outright program failure. Modern weapons have become enormously complex internetworked systems of systems, technology is evolving at an increasing rate, and current acquisition practices may be exacerbating poor program performance. Lean and agile acquisition and systems engineering practices are emerging to help overcome the challenges of rapidly fielding complex new systems in the face of dynamic and uncertain market conditions and ever increasing military and intelligence threats in order to satisfy enterprise and mission needs today. Lean and agile acquisition and systems engineering as we know it today is a relatively new paradigm for managing high-risk, time-sensitive, research and development-oriented new product development projects. It seems to be the ideal model for modern, post-industrial information age knowledge workers. In reality, however, it has a long and rich history and lineage. Its tenets can be traced back to Roman Infantry Tactics, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Sir Isaac Newton, and the principles of experimentation used by Louis Pasteur in the 1800s and Thomas Edison in the early 1900s. DoD also used its basic tenets to develop experimental aircraft throughout the 20th century.

However, this integration is associated with magnified risk and compromise from cyber attacks. Potential cyber attacks could be from an external source where a node is accessed by a malicious intruder using NEC, or internal to the vehicle such as a passive attack waiting to be triggered by an event. This paper provides an understanding of applying survivable systems principles of preventive and reactive mechanisms to the vehicle's integrated vetronics in order to mitigate internal and external threats. Requirements are derived and a novel top level architecture for vetronics survivability is presented.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6136914/,googlescholar

2014,Handling complexity in system of systems projects–lessons learned from MBSE efforts in border security projects,"Well-established systems engineering approaches are becoming more inadequate as today’s systems are becoming more complex, more global, more COTS/re-use based and more evolving. Increased level of outsourcing, significant amount of subcontractors, more integration than development, reduced project cycles, ecosystem like collaborative developments, software product lines and global development are some of the changes in the project life cycle approaches. By structuring data into views with a common language and format, architecture frameworks can be utilized as tools for managing system complexity. In EADS, both architecture frameworks and MBSE are considered as major areas in the future of contemporary systems engineering practices. In this paper, we share our experiences towards adopting MBSE in border security projects where the role of EADS is the system of systems integrator. From the practitioner’s point of view, lessons learned presented in this paper can help companies to increase the speed of shift from traditional systems engineering approaches to architecture driven, knowledge focused and model-based systems engineering practices.",10.1007/978-3-319-02812-5_21,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02812-5_21,googlescholar

The rapid acceptance and demonstrated effectiveness of DSO in software system development have led to proposals for its adoption in more complex projects. This document provides guidance to projects interested in implementing DSO in defense or other highly regulated environments, including those involving systems of systems. The report provides rationale for adopting DSO and the dimensions of change required for that adoption. It introduces DSO, its principles, operations, and expected benefits. It describes objectives and activities needed to implement the DSO ecosystem, including preparation, establishment, and management. Preparation is necessary to create achievable goals and expectations and to establish feasible increments for building the ecosystem. Establishing the ecosystem includes evolving the culture, automation, processes, and system architecture from their initial state toward an initial capability. Managing the ecosystem includes measuring and monitoring both the health of the ecosystem and the performance of the organization. Additional information on the conceptual foundations of the DSO approach is also provided.",,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1121856,googlescholar

2016,Formally describing the architectural behavior of software-intensive systems-of-systems with SosADL,"Software-intensive systems are often independently developed, operated, managed, and evolved. Progressively, communication networks have enabled these independent systems to interact, yielding a new kind of complex system, i.e. a system that is itself composed of systems, the so-called System-of-Systems (SoS). By its complex nature, SoS exhibits emergent behaviors. Nowadays, none of the Architecture Description Languages (ADLs), which have been developed for modeling the architectural behavior of single software-intensive systems, has the expressive power to formally describe the architectural behavior of Software-intensive SoSs. For addressing this research challenge, we propose a novel ADL, called SosADL, specially conceived for formally describing the architecture of Software-intensive SoSs. It embodies SoS architectural concepts and constructs encompassing the formal description of software architectures from both the structural and behavioral viewpoints. This paper presents SosADL focusing on the description of the architectural behavior of Software-intensive SoSs. It describes SosADL from its behavioral viewpoint enabling to specify independent systems, mediators among these systems, coalitions of mediated systems, and the architectural conditions that enforce the production of emergent SoS behaviors. It illustrates SosADL through an excerpt of a real application for architecting a Flood Monitoring and Emergency Response SoS.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7816565/,googlescholar

2005,Factors influencing system-of-systems architecting and integration costs,"Today's need for more complex, more capable systems in a short timeframe is leading more organizations towards the integration of existing systems into network-centric, knowledge-based system-of-systems (SoS). Software and system cost model tools to-date have focused on the software and system development activities of a single software system. As we view the new SoS architectures, we find that the effort associated with the integration of these SoSs is not handled well, if at all, in current cost models. USC's Center for Software Engineering (CSE) began work on a SoS cost model, the Constructive SoS Integration Model (COSOSIMO), in late 2003. This model has evolved using feedback obtained from USC CSE affiliates and other experts in industry and academia. This paper presents an overview of the COSOSIMO cost model, descriptions of the size drivers and cost factors currently in the model, a summary of survey feedback received from USC CSE affiliates and other interested experts from industry, and the impact of survey findings on the current COSOSIMO cost model. It concludes with future plans for the COSOSIMO model.",,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jo-Lane-2/publication/228913720_Factors_Influencing_System-of-Systems_Architecting_and_Integration_Costs/links/557ddb4208aeb61eae247b57/Factors-Influencing-System-of-Systems-Architecting-and-Integration-Costs.pdf,googlescholar

2009,Exploring the synergy between Industrial Ecology and System of Systems to understand complexity: a case study in air transportation,"Two objectives are pursued in this article. First, from a methodological perspective, we explore the relationships among the constructs of complex adaptive systems, systems of systems, and industrial ecology. Through examination of central traits of each, we find that industrial ecology and system of systems present complementary frameworks for posing systemic problems in the context of sociotechnical applications. Furthermore, we contend that complexity science (the basis for the study of complex adaptive systems) provides a natural and necessary foundation and set of tools to analyze mechanisms such as evolution, emergence, and regulation in these applications. The second objective of the article is to illustrate the use of two tools from complexity sciences to address a network transition problem in air transportation framed from the system-of-systems viewpoint and shaped by an industrial ecology perspective. A stochastic simulation consisting of network theory analysis combined with agent-based modeling to study the evolution of an air transport network is presented. Patterns in agent behavior that lead to preferred outcomes across two scenarios are observed, and the implications of these results for decision makers are described. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity for future efforts to combine the merits of both system of systems and industrial ecology in tackling the issues of complexity in such large-scale, sociotechnical problems.",10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,googlescholar

2017,Emergence as innovation in systems of systems—A three systems model,"While emergence tends to be discussed as an outcome of a system of systems (SoS), it should be viewed as a process. Emergence is often the result of innovation within an SoS. We contend that, because of the complex adaptive nature of SoS, the assessment of the potential for innovation to create positive change is necessary for effective evolutionary planning. Innovation potential represents the convergence of three systems: the system of interest, the innovation system, and the context where these interact and come together. The three-system model is a useful perspective to assess the potential impact of innovation on the evolution of an SoS, and to describe the context of SoS emergence as enabled or constrained by its innovation system. We describe a set of methods and tools adapted from both SoS engineering and human-centered design which can be used for strategic design and planning of SoS evolution. The methods and tools are discussed with respect to the potential emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into the context of urban transportation systems, a complex adaptive SoS.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7994975/,googlescholar
2007,Diagnostics to Prognostics-A product availability technology evolution,"From the customer's perspective, one of the most critical expectations of R&M in the new frontier focuses on product availability and cost of ownership. Whether you consider a personal automobile or a pilot's avionics, it must operate reliably, on demand, at an affordable cost. Consumer products such as automobiles, aircraft engines, medical diagnostic equipment, and computer server farms already employ remote diagnostics to monitor product health and optimize product availability. In this context, the next frontier is to evolve robust diagnostics into maturing prognostics and embed these technologies in our products in the form of health management system (HMS) capabilities. Using health based information for real time mission planning and autonomic maintenance is a key enabler for achieving ultra-reliability and availability in tomorrow's system of systems environment. The problem we face is how to best achieve these HMS capable products in a cost effective manner. Today's robust diagnostic technologies are proving to be key enablers for condition based maintenance, improved fault detection/fault isolation, and lower operational cost. Some success has been realized with the insertion of early prognostic technology, primarily in the area of mechanical PHM applications. By using a systematic methodology to develop, implement, and mature electronic prognostics into the next generation of HMS capable products, we are providing our customers (and most importantly the end user in the field) with new insight into the health and system readiness of our products. Being able to make health based decisions for mission planning, real time operational modes, and just-in-time maintenance will become the key to meeting product availability at an affordable cost",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4126334/,googlescholar

This paper reports an experience in the Brazilian defense scenario, externalizing the acquired knowledge in the form of lessons learned during the conduction of a real, strategic project called SisGAAz (Blue Amazon Management System), which has its main goal to develop the Brazilian navy management SoS. In particular, we focus on reporting our experience in the architectural design of this SoS as a quality driver in our project. We also raise challenges that were overcome, and also others that must still be faced. The results communicated herein contribute to deliver a panorama of the Brazilian state of the practice about SoS engineering.

2012,Assessing the impact of development disruptions and dependencies in analysis of alternatives of system-of-systems,"The development of a System-of-Systems SoS remains a highly challenging endeavor due to the complex interdependencies between systems that often times exhibit managerial and operational independence, yet, must work cohesively to achieve an overarching set of capabilities. Current guidelines set forth by the Department of Defense SoS System Engineering guide presents SoS SE as a set of seven core elements which are connected to the 16 technical and management processes in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook DAG. This guide, however, and subsequent frameworks such as the Wave Model, are meant to raise awareness of the key issues and products involved. A need exists to create and mature decision support tools to support the decision making process of evolving SoS architectures this includes the need for properly assessing the impact that potential disruptions can have, and the analysis of alternatives of SoS constructs. Trades between capability and risk are essential decisions that must be addressed for SoS capability planning. Existing tools for such trades, where they exist, can be ineffective and non-intuitive when size andor interdependency complexity is high. These features create a tradeoff space between development risk and capability potential of a system. The objective of RT-36 was to explore analytical methods to quantify the impact of system interdependencies in the context of SoS capability development and use this to guide system engineering activity for SoS. A variety of approaches are investigated to provide a means to conduct analysis of alternatives while navigating the decision space that simultaneously considers the potential positive impacts of interdependencies e.g., SoS capability as well as the negative impacts e.g. consequences of disruption in development. The research in RT-36 centered on seven analytical methods that have been adapted to support SoS architecting decisions and systems engineering of constituent systems.",,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA582893,googlescholar
2019,Architecting systems‐of‐systems and their constituents: A case study applying Industry 4.0 in the construction domain,"The development of system-of-systems (SoS) requires a continuous interplay between design decisions on the SoS level and those on the level of its constituent systems (CS), which often preexist and need to be adapted as the SoS evolves. This involves not only preparing the CS to participate in a particular SoS, but also designing the CS architecture to make it easily adaptable to a future SoS context. The problem is in part addressed in an emerging SoS framework in the manufacturing domain called Industry 4.0. It focuses on connected and digitalized production with the ambition of increasing flexibility and efficiency. This paper investigates how Industry 4.0 standards can be used in an SoS context to make CS more flexible and adaptive, and evaluates their usefulness outside manufacturing. The study is based on a case from the construction domain, for which a generic SoS architecture is developed. Several extensions and adaptations of Industry 4.0 are suggested, including specifications of ontologies for missions and workflows.",10.1002/sys.21516,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.21516,googlescholar

2007,An engineering systems perspective on system of systems methodology,"Traditional methodologies for system design and development have proven insufficient when it comes to very large and distributed systems. As a consequence, research on complex socio-technical systems i.e. System-of-Systems [SoS], has evolved, At the same time, researchers of complex systems that are not SoS have started to pay attention to the tools and methods developed within the area of SoS. The purpose of this paper is therefore twofold: (1) to improve the understanding of SoS and SoS methods from a non-SoS point of view, by presenting SoS definitions, properties and behavior of SoS, and (2) to analyze current non-SoS development methodologies to test their applicability in a SoS environment. Finally a metric for the well-being of a SoS is introduced.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4258864/,googlescholar

2014,A quantified system-of-systems modeling framework for robust national infrastructure planning,"National infrastructure (NI) systems (i.e., energy, transport, water, waste, and information and communications technology) provide essential services to the economy and contribute to human well-being. These systems have evolved over centuries, being planned and implemented piecewise, and are mostly managed in isolation from one another. Here, we argue that the growing interconnection between these systems and the convergent challenges ahead (i.e., demographic, technological, and climate change) call for an integrated “system-of-systems” approach to managing NI. Toward that end, we propose a modeling framework for the long-term (to 2100) simulation of NI system performance in a highly uncertain future. The approach is based on the assessment of the performance of infrastructure services in a wide range of possible future conditions. This robust optimization is used to identify cross-sectoral strategies that ensure satisfactory infrastructure performance. We demonstrate the framework using Great Britain's NI as an example.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6939636/,googlescholar

2006,"A new conceptual framework for net-centric, enterprise-wide, system-of-systems engineering","In large endeavors in business and war, competitive advantage often requires capabilities that result from the interoperability of many systems and the integration of many processes. To succeed in these endeavors, enterprises seek to create and maintain their best capabilities considering performance, cost, risk, and agility under rapidly evolving circumstances. While achieving the best capabilities within budget and schedule constraints may be straightforward for individual systems with documented performance requirements, it is more difficult to achieve for functions that are enabled by multiple systems i.e., systems-of-systems and even more difficult to achieve across large, multi-functional enterprises. DOD is faced by these challenges at multiple scales within and across many interacting functional areas and across its enterprise. To facilitate progress, it effectively and sometimes explicitly designates specific SOSs and associated controlling authorities at the OSD, military service, and functional levels. It also introduces integrating concepts such as architectures, processes such as functional capability boards, and SOS-related concepts such as portfolio management. This paper presents a theoretical framework for thinking about SOSs on a large scale, a net-centric approach to SOS engineering, and a way ahead for DOD.",,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA453974,googlescholar
