2015,"Systems of Systems Engineering: Basic Concepts, Model-Based Techniques, and Research Directions","The term “System of Systems” (SoS) has been used since the 1950s to describe systems that are composed of independent constituent systems, which act jointly towards a common goal through the synergism between them. Examples of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production, and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence, heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field. A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural description, simulation, verification, and testing. Finally, the identified dimensions of SoS characteristics are used to identify research challenges and future research areas of model-based SoS engineering.",10.1145/2794381,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2794381,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2022,Coevolutionary Network Model for Efficient Collaboration in Systems-of-Systems,"Collaborative systems-of-systems (CSoSs) are defined by the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge as groups of constituent systems that voluntarily work with each other toward a common goal. As the complexity and sociotechnical interactions of real systems increases, so too does our need to understand how to design and manage collaboration. The metric of collaboration efficiency (CE) is introduced as a measure of collaboration in any defined CSoS structure. To test the effect of constituent system parameters on CE, an agent-based model is developed that combines network evolution mechanisms (to model a system-of-systems) with evolutionary game theory (to model collaboration). Simulation results suggest that a reactive collaboration strategy or a reinforcement algorithm-based strategy converges to the highest CE in a CSoS, with 29.6% and 34.1%, respectively. The proposed approach and results allow conclusions about the best collaboration choices constituent systems should make when participating in CSoSs. Applicable to systems in energy, logistics, social organizations, infrastructure, and more, this research can improve the design and operation of systems in any CSoS.",10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812631,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2022,Reinforcement Learning based System-of-Systems Approach for UAV Swarms Behavioral Evolution,"Advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies have enabled the development of biologically inspired swarms or fleets of UAVs that collaboratively achieve common mission objectives such as in surveillance and remote sensing applications. Typically, such swarms comprise of homogeneous UAVs that are developed using same techniques to serve the same purpose. However, the recent proliferation of UAV development by numerous research and commercial entities, using varied machine learning models to serve diverse purposes, has induced the need to rethink swarm development using heterogeneous UAVs that can adapt and achieve common objectives despite differences in their design and associated intelligence. In this paper, we present a novel approach to develop swarms of heterogeneous UAVs as System-of-Systems (SoS), and enabling behavioral evolution and adaptation of constituent UAVs through Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. The proposed approach involves SoS-Constituent System Measures Of Effectiveness Relationship (SSMR) model that correlates the Measures Of Effectiveness (MOEs) for the SoS with the MOEs of the constituent system UAVs. By formulating the SSMR as the reward mechanism of RL, our approach incorporates an Intelligent-Behavior Evolution Agent with the necessary constraints to learn to maximize the SoS and system-level MOEs, while adapting itself to the evolution in the swarm SoS. The initial experimental results indicate that our approach adequately trains these independent agents to be used in heterogeneous swarms.",10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773900,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,Preliminary Evolutionary Network Model for Efficient Collaboration in Systems-of-Systems,"Collaborative systems-of-systems (CSoSs) are defined by the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge as groups of constituent systems that voluntarily work with each other toward a common goal.

An agent-based model is developed that combines network evolution mechanisms with evolutionary game theory to simulate CSoSs. Collaboration efficiency (CE) is introduced as a metric by which collaboration may be measured and performance compared. Cost and strategy parameters of constituent systems are tested via CSoS model simulation to develop insights into best collaboration practices for CSoSs. Results suggest a reactive collaboration strategy or a reinforcement algorithm-based strategy produce the highest CE under certain conditions.

2021,Communication Oriented Modeling of Evolving Systems of Systems,"Systems of Systems (SoSs) are composed of systems characterized by operational and managerial independence, but that can perform tasks together that they could not do by themselves. Given their potential complexity, modeling and testing such systems can be a daunting task, which is repeated when any system is evolved into a new one, especially when SoSs pertain to different owners. We propose a framework for modeling SoSs using only observable communication properties and dataflow. In this paper, we propose a framework that supports SoS design and discuss how it can support the creation of complex use cases pertaining to multiple owners. We implemented a proof-of-concept for the framework that focuses on REST-based communication and combines design using the model-based engineering tool Papyrus, and verification of communication properties using the Uppaal model checker.

2021,Evolving Remote Sensing Applications as System-of-Systems,"There has been significant expansion in the functionality and differentiation of modern remote sensing applications due to the exponential growth in adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). With recent advancements of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning (AI-ML) and Cloud Computing, many opportunities have emerged to significantly evolve UAV based remote sensing applications. This paper presents a novel approach to evolve remote sensing application as a System-of-Systems (SoS). Bringing in the SoS perspective provides additional insights into the dynamics of the interactions between the various constituent systems (e.g. swarm UAVs, Ground stations) and the impact on the overall remote sensing application. Systematically analyzing the relationships between the various Measures-of-Effectiveness (MOEs) of the SoS vis-a-vis the constituent systems, in tandem with the evolution of the MOEs, would enable optimal leverage of the recent technology advancements for remote sensing applications",10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553649,,ieeeexplore; scopus

2020,Architectural Models Enabled Dynamic Optimization for System-of-Systems Evolution,"System of Systems (SoS) is designed to deliver value to participant stakeholders in a dynamic and uncertain environment where new systems are added and current systems are removed continuously and on their own volition. This requires effective evolution management at the SoS architectural level with adequate support of process, methods, and tools. This paper follows the principle of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and develops a holistic framework integrating MBSE conceptual representations and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to support the SoS evolution. The conceptual models provide a common architectural representation to improve communication between various decision makers while the dynamic optimization method suggests evolution planning decisions from the analytical perspective. The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) models using Systems Modeling Language (SysML) are used as MBSE artifacts to connect with ADP modeling elements through DoDAF metamodels to increase information traceability and reduce unnecessary information loss. Using a surface warfare SoS as an example, this paper demonstrates and explains the procedures of developing DoDAF models, mapping DoDAF models to ADP elements, formulating ADP formulation, and generating evolutionary decisions. The effectiveness of using ADP in supporting evolution to achieve a near-optimal solution that can maximize the SoS capability over time is illustrated by comparing ADP solution to other alternative solutions. The entire framework also sheds light on bridging the DoDAF-based conceptual models and other mathematical optimization methods. © 2020 Zhemei Fang et al.",10.1155/2020/7534819,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/7534819/,scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

A collaborative optimization method based on coevolutionary game is proposed to solve this problem. More specifically, it first provides a standardized design decision model for a large number of heterogeneous systems within an SoS in order to reduce the organizational complexity of the design process significantly, and then uses different game models to describe the collaborative interactions between heterogeneous systems and effectively deal with various coupling constraints and objective conflicts in the evolutionary design process of the SoS. Then, the multi-attribute utility theory, experimental design method, response surface modeling technology and differential evolution algorithm are combined to find a satisfactory global optimal solution with the least information exchange and iterative process.

2018,Developing and evolving a DSL-based approach for runtime monitoring of systems of systems,"Complex software-intensive systems are often described as systems of systems (SoS) due to their heterogeneous architectural elements. As SoS behavior is often only understandable during operation, runtime monitoring is needed to detect deviations from requirements. Today, while diverse monitoring approaches exist, most do not provide what is needed to monitor SoS, e.g., support for dynamically defining and deploying diverse checks across multiple systems. In this paper we report on our experiences of developing, applying, and evolving an approach for monitoring an SoS in the domain of industrial automation software, that is based on a domain-specific language (DSL). We first describe our initial approach to dynamically define and check constraints in SoS at runtime and then motivate and describe its evolution based on requirements elicited in an industry collaboration project. We furthermore describe solutions we have developed to support the evolution of our approach, i.e., a code generation approach and a framework to automate testing the DSL after changes. We evaluate the expressiveness and scalability of our new DSL-based approach using an industrial SoS. We also discuss lessons we learned. Our results show that while developing a DSL-based approach is a good solution to support industrial users, one must prepare the approach for evolution, by making it extensible and adaptable to future scenarios. Particularly, support for automated (re-)generation of tools and code after changes and automated testing are essential. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10515-018-0241-x,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10515-018-0241-x,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar; scopus

2008,System-of-Systems Engineering Management: A Review of Modern History and a Path Forward,"As our knowledge of system of systems (SoS) has grown and evolved, so has our understanding of how to engineer and manage them. In systems engineering, we develop architectures and frameworks to bring meaning to this kind of uncertainty, but for SoS engineering (SoSE) we are still in search of how we can structure this understanding. In this paper, we review the SoS literature to illustrate the need to create an SoSE management framework based on the demands of constant technological progress in a complex dynamic environment. We conclude from this review that the history and evolution of defining SoS has shown that: (1) SoS can be defined by distinguishing characteristics and (2) SoS can be viewed as a network where the ldquobest practicesrdquo of network management can be applied to SoSE. We use these two theories as a foundation for our objective to create an effective SoSE management framework. To accomplish this, we utilize modified fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) network principles (SoSE management conceptual areas). Furthermore, cited distinguishing characteristics of SoS are also used to present a SoSE management framework. We conclude with a case analysis of this framework using a known and well-documented SoS (i.e., Integrated Deepwater System) to illustrate how to better understand, engineer, and manage within the domain of SoSE.",10.1109/JSYST.2008.2007163,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4682611/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2017,Evolution Model of Equipment Support System of Systems Based on Complex Network Theory,"The equipment support system of systems (SOS) architecture plays a decisive role in the effectiveness and adaptability of SOS, and the evolution model is a key technology to construct the equipment support SOS architecture. An improved evolution model of equipment support SOS based on the multi-weighted network is proposed for the heterogeneity of the entities in the equipment support SOS and the impact of the support mission requirements on the architecture evolution. The network characteristics of equipment support SOS is analyzed, the complex network theory is introduced to construct the initial weighted network model of the equipment support SOS, and the network evaluation indexes are presented. On this basis, the network evolution rule and the improved evolution model are proposed. In the weighted network model, the support mission requirements are abstracted as the network nodes, and the uncertainty of mission requirements is described by a quaternion, and the fitness index is used to link support mission requirements with the SOS architecture. The heterogeneity of network nodes is characterized by the type and support capability of nodes, and regarded as a major factor in the evolution process. The simulation experimental results show that the improved model can be used to determine the influence of the support mission on the evolution process, improve the adaptability of SOS architecture to the mission, and enhance the SOS effectiveness in a certain range. © 2017, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii.

2013,A system of systems approach to the evolutionary transformation of power management systems,"Power management systems of the future will be very different from the ones today. They will be complex systems of systems that directly incorporate distributed energy resources into the scheduling processes, react much quicker to changes in power demand and production than today's, and will allow small groups of producers and consumers to participate in the power market. This will lead to a more flexible, robust, and scalable power grid if the technological challenges can be mastered. We propose techniques that support this transition in five evolutionary steps, incorporating proven as well as new ideas. These steps are founded in the belief that agency of system components like power plants, trust as a measure of uncertainty, and self-organisation will be the keys to tackle the challenges at hand.

2017,An Event-Based Capture-and-Compare Approach to Support the Evolution of Systems of Systems,"Industrial software systems are often systems of systems (SoS) that evolve continuously to meet new customer requirements or to address technological changes. Despite thorough testing of the different contributing parts, the full behavior of SoS only emerges at runtime. The systems in the SoS and their interactions thus need to be continuously monitored and checked during operation to determine compliance with requirements. In particular, after changes to one system, it is necessary to check whether the overall SoS still behaves correctly and as intended. Based on an existing monitoring framework we have been developing support for capturing and comparing event traces in SoS. Our approach facilitates and partly automates the identification of differences in event traces, which often indicate undesirable behavior introduced during evolution. In this paper we motivate the need for monitoring and evolution support in SoS using an industrial example and describe our event-based capture-and-compare approach. We evaluate the applicability and scalability of our tool-supported approach, demonstrating that it can cope with comparing event traces from an industrial SoS.

2015,Interoperability as a key concept for the control and evolution of the system of systems (Sos),"A coalition of enterprises wanting to collaborate, and more generally a Collaborative Network of Organizations (CNO), can conceptually be assimilated as a System of Systems (SoS) presenting a number of characteristics to respect all over its life cycle. Interoperability is one of these characteristics (both functional and non-functional), which is from our point of view, essential in order to guarantee the control of the SoS, its behavior and the fulfillment of its mission(s). Moreover, it ensures the reaction of the SoS to deal with some risky situations and with potential local or global deficits during its functioning. In this paper, we propose to determine the relation between the current level of interoperability of the SoS and its functioning whatever may be its situation. A matrix shows how this relation evolves taking into account several characteristics of the SoS, particularly its capacity to respect interoperability requirements (Compatibility, Interoperation, Autonomy and Reversibility) and the so-called analysis perspectives of the SoS: Performance, Integrity and Stability. This relation is requested in order to permit and to guide SoS behavioral simulation currently in development. Thus, a set of indicators is derived and formalized. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",10.1007/978-3-662-47157-9_5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-47157-9_5,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar

2017,Using evolutionary theory in studying the development of system of systems,"The paper describes a systems approach to study the evolution and development of a System of systems, particularly in military context. In this article, the System of systems is a socio-technical structure, where Information and Communication Technology is intertwined with human and other structural parts. Due to the interaction with the environment and between intertwined parts, System of systems is complex and dynamic in nature. Most of the system engineering or design methods tend to over-reduce the situation or over-emphasise some parts. When developing models describing the possible future states, Enterprise Architects struggle to analyse what future is practical to achieve. To overcome these challenges, a research method based on systems thinking is introduced. The foundation for the method was presented in Darwinian (1859) Theory of evolution. It is applied to technical systems by Mokyr (1998). Since the system in the Mokyr’s model was found too monolithic, Andriani’s and Carigani’s (2012) approach is applied to introduce modular design and innovation. Mokyr defines knowledge as underlying structure needed to design systems. Creating knowledge is extended using features of Choo’s (1998) model for Knowing Organisation. The extended model is tested with basic features presented in Bertalanffy’s (1968) general system theory. The model for the evolution of the socio-technical system of systems is corroborated with the use case in the military evolution of mechanised forces and manoeuvre tactics (Vego, 2007). The research model has been this far used in studying the capabilities of military command, control, communications, computing, and information. The business level studies have addressed the development of military knowledge management and the evolution of military training. The information level study has dealt with evolving military information management. All three studies provided tools for Enterprise Architects to do business level analyses both for the current and help in defining possible end states for strategies. © 2017 Academic Conferences Limited.

2014,"Integrated Analysis of Functional and Developmental Interdependencies to Quantify and Trade-off Ilities for System-of-Systems Design, Architecture, and Evolution","When complex systems and systems-of-systems are involved, the behavior of the whole entity is not only due to that of the individual systems, but also to the interactions and interdependencies between the systems. Classical systems engineering approach is not always suitable to manage such feature, and new tools and methods are required, capable to identify, analyze and quantify properties of the system-of-systems as a whole. This research addresses the need to deal with complex dependencies between systems, in both developmental and functional relationships. We propose a combination of two previously developed methods, to analyze functional and developmental dependencies between systems in a system-of-systems, and to assess the impact of such dependencies on metrics that characterize global prop erties of a system-of-systems over its life span known as ilities. The analysis can be used to drive decisions for system-of- systems design, architecture, and evolution, with respect to the identified metrics of interest. It also accounts for the presence of multiple stakeholders, and external factors that influence the operability and the development of a system-of-systems. The methods support the analysis of trade-offs between competing ilities and facilitates identification of better performing architectures. We show preliminary results of the application of the methods, and how the results can be interpreted to evaluate system-of-system ilities on synthetic problems.

2014,An Analytic Workbench Perspective to Evolution of System of Systems Architectures,"The development of a large group of interdependently operating systems, or ‘System of Systems (SoS)’, presents significant challenges across technical, operational and programmatic dimensions. Trades between cost, schedule, performance, and associated spectrum of risks, are essential during analysis of alternatives for both individual systems and the SoS architecture as a whole. The large number of decision variables involved, ubiquitous uncertainty and complex interactions that exist between systems creates analysis problems that go well beyond the immediate mental faculties of decision-makers. Often times, the decisions made focus on localized development at the systems level with little consideration for cascading effects on the bigger SoS picture. Hence, the process of evolving SoS architectures requires tools that provides the SoS practitioner with meaningful analytical quantifications of the SoS tradespace. In the defense arena, existing tools for such trades, have been guided by policies set forth in the Defense Acquisitions Guidebook (DAG) (5000 series) and the System Engineering Guide for System of Systems (SoS-SE), but are lacking an analytic perspective towards more informed decision-making. This paper discusses a multidisciplinary effort, funded by the DoD's Systems Engineering research Center (SERC), to establish an analytic workbench of computational tools to facilitate better-informed decision-making on SoS architectures. The work is motivated by the idea that SoS practitioners possess relevant information and archetypal questions that reflect desired outcomes at the SoS level. These archetypal, technically -driven queries are mapped to relevant methods that can provide analytical outputs to directly support SoS acquisition and architectural decisions. The applicability and respective value-added of each method in addressing various archetypal measures are presented.",10.1016/j.procs.2014.03.084,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914001471,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,Dynamic Planning of System of Systems Architecture Evolution,"The dynamic planning and development of a large collection of systems or a ‘System of Systems’ (SoS) pose significant programmatic challenges due to the complex interactions that exist between its constituent systems. Decisions to add, remove, or reconstitute connections between systems can result in repercussive failures across operational and developmental dimensions of an SoS. The work conducted in this research is part of a larger body of work funded by the DoD Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) towards the development of an Analytic Workbench. This paper in particular develops a tool that adopts an operations research-based perspective to SoS level planning based on metrics of cost, performance, schedule and risk. Specifically, our work employs an Approximate Dynamic Programming approach that is well suited to address issues of computational tractability of the resulting dynamic planning optimization problem. This approach allows for identification of near-optimal multi-stage decisions in evolving SoS architectures. A Naval Warfare Scenario SoS example problem illustrates application of the method.",10.1016/j.procs.2014.03.055,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914001185,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,OSM: An Evolutionary System of Systems Framework for Modeling and Simulation,"In this paper, we propose a novel Orchestrated Simulation through Modeling (OSM) framework that allows output visualizations and Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) frames to be developed separately as plug-ins and combined to form a complete system. Independently developed plug-ins can be added and removed as desired to dramatically change the system. This design allows input plug-ins (model, experimental), execution plug-ins (simulator), and output plug-ins to be developed separately and pieced together to form a unique system while allowing development to be compartmentalized. With the OSM framework, an evolutionary system of systems can be intelligently created by a community. Each community member only needs to fully understand the pieces they personally develop. The performance and scalability of our proposed OSM framework is discussed in an evolutionary system of systems domain pointing to its efficiency and usability.",10.5555/2664292.2664293,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2664292.2664293,acm; scopus; googlescholar

2012,Developing a methodology to support the evolution of System of Systems using risk analysis,"The potential for uncontrolled evolution of member systems is one of the most significant challenges facing SoS (System of Systems) management. Lack of control in evolution makes organizations more inefficient, raises costs, and can affect their ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstance. SoS bring together individual systems to fulfill shared goals, but the systems are likely to have been developed independently, and to different development and operational standards. Member systems retain much of their autonomy, along with their motivations and goals. This increases the risk of decisions relating to evolution being taken unilaterally within member systems, potentially to the detriment of the stability, efficiency and dependability of the SoS. This paper proposes a methodology to support non specialist end users in the identification, organization and discussion of information required to manage SoS evolution, and uses a modified form of HAZOPS (Hazard and Operability Study) to analyze the associated risks of evolution. The paper evaluates the methodology using a case study based on a recent RAF (Royal Air Force) Nimrod air crash, the official investigation into which showed severe failings in the operation of the Nimrod SoS. The paper concludes that the methodology proposed would provide valuable support to SoS evolution processes, and discusses future directions for the research. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.20194,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.20194,scopus; wiley; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,The evolutionary optimization of system of systems based on Agent model,"In recent years, the concept of system of systems (SoS) has emerged as a new approach to solving complex problems. Since every system evolves, the evolution has become a significant characteristic of SoS. The Agent, a self-adaptive entity, which has the perception, adaption and reaction to the changes of the environment, operates in a dynamic environment. Consequently, a method to research the evolutionary optimization of SoS based on Agent model is proposed. Since each Agent is optimized autonomously, the Agents can adopt different optimization method according to their characteristics. This is a method called “from bottom to top”, which is suitable for solving the problem of large complex systems. Finally, the conclusions are given. The evolutionary optimization of SoS based on Agent model is feasible and effective, which can be deeply researched in the future.",10.1109/ICSSE.2014.6887940,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Several key factors affect the value of every particular piece of work, and those factors can change over time as the actual work effort evolves, the requirements change, and the value of desired capabilities independently rise and fall. Most scheduling approaches are predictive and based on predetermined fixed values to support earned-value requirements or contracting guidelines. This paper investigates an on-demand scheduling approach with a continuous assignment of value to work. Value for work is based on current work in progress, task dependencies, resource capabilities and availability, development system capacity, and the intrinsic value of the work with respect to the capabilities under development.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2014.6892505,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

The evolution of SoS is the rule and not the exception in practice due to frequently changing requirements, technologies, and markets. However, providing adequate support for the evolution of SoS is rather challenging as their behavior often emerges at runtime and is difficult to predict. Hence, SoS must be monitored during simulation and operation to ensure compliance with its requirements. In this position paper, we present challenges for SoS evolution from the domain of industrial automation. We discuss existing approaches supporting SoS evolution and derive research issues.

2013,Architectures for Evolving System of Systems in Complex Environments,The paper describes design methods for designing a system of systems. Here a system must be designed to both carry out its function and also to fit in with other systems. Design goes beyond optimizing one system but must provide ways to sustain relationships between systems in open complex environments. The nature of a system of systems is complex as individual systems must respond to any changes in related systems. They are characterized by continuous emergence and the need to maintain system integration as systems change and support creativity and innovation. The paper describes architectural framework made up of two parts that provides a structure to model systems and their emergence. The first is an open system structure that models organizational structures that can evolve. This goes beyond the traditional hierarchical systems used in many models. Instead it sees organizational structures as collaborating open systems that are gradually leading to a social rather than hierarchical structure. The second is the collaborative architecture based on social networking superimposed on the structure to model collaboration between the systems. It thus combines social networking and an open model of business systems to provide a unified framework to model a system of systems.,10.1007/978-1-4614-7540-8_15,,springerlink

2021,Evolutionary Algorithm for Incremental Scheduling in Systems of Systems with Real-Time Requirements,"Time-triggered Systems-of-Systems (SoS) promise to satisfy the real-time and dependability requirements of safety-relevant applications such as medical systems, smart manufacturing and defense systems. However, the time-triggered scheduling algorithms in the state-of-the-art were developed for monolithic systems and they do not support the requirements and constraints of SoS. Scheduling tasks and optimizing the resource allocation in SoS is more complex than in monolithic systems due to the autonomy of its constituting systems, the lack of central control, and no global information about the resources in different constituent systems.In this article, we propose a two-level interactive heuristic approach using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to schedule real-time applications incrementally by adding them to the time-triggered SoS. We compute and deploy the schedule for each new SoS application at runtime after its arrival. Therefore, the limited communication and computational resources must be shared between different SoS applications released over time. By reducing the blocking time of shared resources, we can cope with the possible shortage of resources for future applications. Therefore, we develop a new resource allocation algorithm which creates more balance in the blocking times of shared resources and helps to satisfy future resource requests. We generate example scenarios to examine the schedulability of our new incremental scheduling algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed optimization scheme compared to an incremental scheduler without blocking time considerations can find a better schedule for a sequence of applications.",10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589124,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2014,Preparing for complex interdependent risks: A System of Systems approach to building disaster resilience,"The uncertainty posed by natural and human-made disasters arises from both known risks and a range of unforeseeable risks, some of which may be novel, not having been observed before. These interconnected risks may evolve over short periods of time and may feed into one another. In a network of multiple causes and effects, such risks may not be foreseeable at the disaster preparedness level, and may only be observed at the time of disaster response. This creates a higher level of complexity and requires new approaches with individual organizations and members needing to make decisions outside predefined frameworks and hierarchical command-control structures while still operating in the ethos of their organizations. This study advocates the need for disaster preparedness strategies to go beyond linear approaches to risk management. This is necessary in order to better address complex interdependent risks where such risks may be novel or unforeseen and which may connect in a cascading manner. The resulting causal network needs to be addressed with a networked approach to enrich existing linear approaches by recognizing the need for an interconnected holistic approach to deal appropriately with interconnected risk factors. This paper takes an interpretive perspective rather than the more typical positivist one. System of Systems (SoS) and complex systems thinking were used to inform a sense-making framework to distinguish between approaches to known/knowable and unknown risks.

2017,Knowledge Based Decision Model for Architecting and Evolving Complex System-of-Systems,"Abstract Architecting complex System-of-System (SoS) has evinced keen interest recently, specifically towards factoring in the operational and managerial independence of the constituent systems, and the evolutionary and adaptive nature of SoS development. Architectural decisions have a significant bearing on the operational measures of success, referred to as Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), of the SoS. There is inherent uncertainty while making an architectural decision for complex SoS due to the incomplete knowledge on the implications of the decision. The impact on the MOEs of the SoS may be realized only later in the development lifecycle, influencing the performance and the emergent behavior of the SoS. Further, when learning cycles on the architectural decisions are experienced, once the implication of decision is realized, there needs to be means for incorporating the feedback on the decisions taken, and to reflect back on the uncertainty associated with the decisions. This paper proposes a knowledge based decision model for architecting and evolving complex SoS, that takes into account the uncertainty associated with architectural decisions and the learning cycles and feedback loops experienced. It also enables augmenting the architectural knowledge base, both at a constituent system level as well as at the System-of-System level. The proposed model adopts a decision oriented view that enables factoring in uncertainty, learning cycles and feedback loops in architectural decisions. It facilitates exploring the implications of various SoS evolution scenarios on architectural decisions, while analyzing MOEs of the SoS in relation to the MOEs of the constituent systems.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2017.00343.x,,wiley
2017,Agile digital transformation of System-of-Systems architecture models using Zachman framework,"Emergent behavior is behavior of a system that does not depend on its individual parts, but on their relationships to one another. Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture: the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF) are declared inappropriate. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the Zachman Framework on the other hand are suitable. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Ultimately, SysML and UML should be integrated with the agent-based model.

2014,An Analytic Portfolio Approach to System of Systems Evolutions,"The development of large collections of systems or a ‘System-of-Systems (SoS)’ is challenging due to the large number of systems involved, complex dynamics attributed to interdependencies between systems, and inherent technical and programmatic uncertainties. The sheer number of decision variables involved in SoS development exceeds the mental faculties of the SoS practitioner, prompting the need for effective analytical support frameworks. Current frameworks and guidelines in addressing SoSE challenges lack analytical means of objective SoS level decision-making. Research in this paper adopts computational decision support methods from financial engineering that allows SoS practitioners the means to identify optimal ‘portfolios’ of systems based on dimensions of capability, cost and operational risk. The SoS architecture is represented as a hierarchical collection generic nodes that interact to provide the overarching SoS level set of capabilities based on an archetypal set of inter- nodal behaviors.

2014,Evolving robust networks for systems-of-systems: Is it viable for large networks?,"Software systems that rely on ad-hoc networks are increasingly complex and prevalent. Some of these systems provide vital functionality to emergency services, military operations, and disaster relief; such systems may have significant impact on the safety of people involved in those operations. It is therefore important that those networks support critical software requirements, including those for latency of packet transfer. If a network ceases to meet the software's requirements (e.g. due to a link failure) then engineers must be able to understand it well enough to reconfigure the network and restore it to a requirement-satisfying state. Given a complex network, it is difficult for a human to do this, especially under time pressure. Tool support would therefore be valuable. This paper presents a search-based tool which takes as input a network defined using the Network Description Language (NDL), annotated with a set of network-hosted applications and a set of latency requirements between each. The tool can evolve variants of the network configuration which meet the requirements and are robust to single link failures, using multi-objective optimisation to resolve the conflicting demands of robustness and low resource use. We have investigated how the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be configured to find good results, and how the time taken to evolve networks scales with the size of the network. We conclude that the approach is effective for small networks (tens of nodes) but scales poorly beyond that. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",10.1007/s10664-013-9295-3,,scopus; springerlink; webofscience

2023,Technology Prioritization and Architecture Flexibility for Space System-of-Systems,"Decision makers face a difficult task when planning large-scale space missions or long-term development of technologies for space systems architectures. The difficulties arise from multiple factors. First, the size of the problem, the diversity of the involved systems and technologies, and the variety of stakeholders and their needs result in a large a complex trade space. Second, technologies are continuously evolving, and it can be hard to find data and model for new technologies, which increases the uncertainty about availability and performance. Third, in these complex problems decision makers need to account not only for traditional engineering trade-off (including cost, time, performance, and risk) but also for policies, stakeholder preferences, and flexibility of space architectures. Building on our previous research in System-of-Systems methodologies, we propose a combination of tools to support decision-making for technology prioritization and analysis of development time, risk, and flexibility of space architectures. Based on developmental dependencies between technologies, Technology Readiness Level (TRL), mission requirements, uncertainty, cost, and budget limitations, the tools produce the optimal expected schedule and allow the user to identify potential bottleneck and risks. Different strategies for prioritization of technologies can also be compared. The tools can handle constraints such as policies or stakeholder preferences, which impose prioritization of certain technologies or space missions. Finally, since long-term space mission planning is very dynamic and its specific objectives change often, we implemented tools to add analysis of flexibility on top of the technology prioritization tools. This analysis is performed from different perspectives. From a mission viewpoint, given a selected mission category (and its associated technologies), we assess how difficult it is to transition to a different mission, in terms of cost and number of technologies that are missing, as well as evaluating differences in cost. From a programmatic viewpoint, we quantify flexibility of specific technology prioritization schedules when decisions to switch to a different mission arise.",10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115852,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2023,Towards SoS Evolution Management for Developing Smarter Cities: Social Significance and Approaches,"Efforts to realize smarter cities are an important pathway to contribute to the achievement of various SDGs. In order to pursue smarter cities in developed countries, it is essential to work on the evolution of SoS (System of Systems), which is how to introduce new systems while coordinating existing systems. So far, several systems engineering studies have been made to evolve SoS in the field of military systems, but the field of socio-technical systems necessary for smarter cities is still unexplored. This paper examines why SoS evolution in socio-technical systems is necessary and how it should be addressed, assuming that it will be applied in actual cities aiming to achieve the SDGs, and proposes an exploratory approach to SoS evolution that incorporates the concept of transition management, which is considered indispensable for social transformation.",10.1007/978-981-19-7776-3_13,,springerlink
2022,"System-of-Systems Architecture Selection: A Survey of Issues, Methods, and Opportunities","System-of-systems (SoSs) architecture concerns the structure of components, their relationships, and their principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time. Well-designed architecture is key to manage the SoS complexity, and thus plays a considerable role in the SoS development and evolution. Architecture selection that aims to identify the desired architectures from a large alternative design space is an initial but critical step toward successful architecture design. Decision-makers need scientific methods to identify those better, more informed but perhaps unexpected architecture solutions. However, the unique SoS characteristics such as interdependency and autonomy bring significant challenges to the architecture selection studies. This article identifies seven critical perspectives in SoS architecture selection, including the conceptual framework, evaluation criteria, interdependency, uncertainty, autonomy, dynamic evolution, and computational methods. The available methods, tools, and processes in the SoS and associated domains are reviewed thoroughly regarding each perspective. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the current research status of SoS architecture selection. It builds a holistic picture that brings the fragmented pieces of the puzzle together. Towards the end, this article presents a series of research directions for future SoS architecture selection studies.",10.1109/JSYST.2021.3119294,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9593274/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2021,MBSE delivers significant return on investment in evolutionary development of complex SoS,"The Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) is a rapidly evolving combat system of systems (SoS) product family. Managing the annual baseline updates requires processing thousands of baseline change requests, then coordinating and verifying their implementation. The complexity of this effort, which involves well over ten million source-lines-of-code (SLOC) as well as Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and military-unique hardware, is compounded by being deployed in ten variants. After a feasibility study in 2010 the SWFTS systems engineering and integration program started a transition from traditional requirements database and document-centric systems engineering (DCSE) to a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) process. At that time there was little solid evidence in the literature for a positive Return on Investment (ROI) for moving from DCSE to MBSE. Applying MBSE to this program has resulted in measurable monetary and operational benefits. We 1) summarize the DCSE to MBSE transition, 2) describe the accomplishments and observations to date, 3) define the metrics collected, and 4) quantify the achieved ROI. Background on the systems engineering and integration (SE&I) process and an apples-to-apples comparison of SE quality and efficiency are provided. The raw SE&I efficiencies of the DCSE and MBSE approaches are documented, along with conclusions showing that the MBSE approach delivers a positive ROI through higher quality SE products at significantly less cost-per-change, enables managing more baselines and SoS complexity using constant resources, and reduces the cost of the downstream integration effort. © 2021 Lockheed Martin Corporation.

2022,The Capability Concept in the Context of Systems of Systems: A Systematic Literature Review,"Systems of systems (SoS) leverage dynamic configuration of independent systems to achieve a capability neither of the independent constituent systems can achieve on their own. Therefore, SoS engineering goes beyond addressing requirements to addressing capabilities. Due to the independence of the constituent systems, capability is formed by complex interdependence of legacy systems. It is also subject to uncertainty of the evolutionary development of the SoS, making it important to not only see the bigger picture but to plan for the changing capability patterns in the life of an SoS. This study looks at the body of knowledge surrounding definitions, support systems and practices around the concept of capability in the context of SoS. The results show; context dependent nature of the definition of capability, country-specific support systems, ongoing efforts to form more robust frameworks and dominant establishment of this theme in the defense sector.",10.1109/ISSE54508.2022.10005489,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,Strategic robustness in bi-level system-of-systems design,"Robust designs protect system utility in the presence of uncertainty in technical and operational outcomes. Systems-of-systems, which lack centralized managerial control, are vulnerable to strategic uncertainty from coordination failures between partially or completely independent system actors. This work assesses the suitability of a game-theoretic equilibrium selection criterion to measure system robustness to strategic uncertainty and investigates the effect of strategically robust designs on collaborative behavior. The work models interactions between agents in a thematic representation of a mobile computing technology transition using an evolutionary game theory framework. Strategic robustness and collaborative solutions are assessed over a range of conditions by varying agent payoffs. Models are constructed on small world, preferential attachment and random graph topologies and executed in batch simulations. Results demonstrate that systems designed to reduce the impacts of coordination failure stemming from strategic uncertainty also increase the stability of the collaborative strategy by increasing the probability of collaboration by partners; a form of robustness by environment shaping that has not been previously investigated in design literature. The work also demonstrates that strategy selection follows the risk dominance equilibrium selection criterion and that changes in robustness to coordination failure can be measured with this criterion.  © ",10.1017/dsj.2022.2,,scopus; webofscience

As the general introductory book of the China Smart Court Development Series, this book provides an overview of the development of Chinese people's courts in the application of information technology over the past two decades and outlines the key areas of exploration in the Smart Court SoSe project centered on the development practices during the 13th Five-Year Plan period. It also forecasts the future development and evolution of the smart court information system. The key topics introduced in the book, including the overall design of complex information systems, integrated interconnection networks-based system integration, judicial big data quality control and analytics services, various types of AI-enabled judicial services, quality and efficiency-oriented operation and maintenance services for large-scale information systems, etc., all came from the basic research of information science and theories, as well as the systems engineering practices of the Smart Court SoSe project. They not only reflect the latest findings on systems engineering and architecture methods in China and overseas, but also reveal many innovative approaches to SoSE methods and paradigms, which can be used for the design and continued development of smart courts at a new and higher starting point. It is believed that they can also serve as good examples and reference points for the development in IT application and complex information systems engineering in other sectors. © People's Court Press 2022.

Regarding target’s attacking as the essential impetus to the SoS response and structural adjustment, the positive and negative effects of target stream on synchronization are discussed, by analyzing the macro characteristics on element attributes and topology evolution under the condition of SoS combat. Integrated with combat ring theory and coupled oscillator model, the mechanism and characterization of SoS phase synchronization are studied. Moreover, the updating method of node phase iteration is presented. Compared with the static-synchronization, the simulation results exhibit obvious differences among the dynamic-synchronization possessing special dynamic characteristic, and the oscillation pattern and synchronization ability. © 2022, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

2022,A SOA-Based Engineering Process Model for the Life Cycle Management of System-of-Systems in Industry 4.0,"The evolution of industrial digitalisation has accelerated in recent years with the availability of hyperconnectivity, low-cost miniaturised electronic components, edge computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. More generally, with these key enablers, the concept of a system of systems (SoS) is becoming a reality in the industry domain. However, due to its complexity, the engineering process model adopted to design, develop, and manage IoT and SoS-based solutions for industry digitalisation is inadequate, inefficient, and frequently unable to manage the digitalisation solution’s entire life cycle. To address these limitations, we propose the Arrowhead Engineering Process (Arrowhead-EP) model and the Value Chain Engineering Process Map (VCEP-map), which explicitly reveal the interactions and dynamics of the engineering processes adopted by multistakeholder use cases in the industry domain. We decomposed and remodeled the engineering process to cover the complete life cycle of an industrial SoS, and we introduced a service-oriented solution intended to efficiently, flexibly, and effectively manage the three assets addressed by RAMI 4.0. The Arrowhead-EP model complemented by the VCEP-map fills the gaps identified in our literature-based analysis and satisfies the requirements of the life cycle management of a typical use case in the Industry 4.0 domain. In this regard, a specific example is used to illustrate the advantages of adopting the proposed engineering solution in a real multistakeholder use case. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/app12157730,,scopus; webofscience
2021,Security and autonomic management in system of systems,"A system of systems integrates systems that function independently but are networked together for a period of time to achieve a higher goal. These systems evolve over time and have emergent properties. Therefore, even with security controls in place, it is difficult to maintain a required level of security for the system of systems as a whole because uncertainties may arise at runtime. Uncertainties can occur from internal factors, such as malfunctions of a system, or from external factors, such as malicious attacks. Self-adaptation is an approach that allows a system to adapt in the face of such uncertainties without human intervention. This work outlines the progress made towards security mitigation in system of systems using a generic autonomic management system to assist engineers in developing self-adaptive systems. The manuscript describes the proposed system design, its implementation as part of the Eclipse Arrowhead framework, and its functionality in a smart agriculture use case.

2021,Iterative and Scenario-Based Requirements Specification in a System of Systems Context,"[Context & Motivation] Due to the managerial, operational and evolutionary independence of constituent systems (CSs) in a System of Systems (SoS) context, top-down and linear requirements engineering (RE) approaches are insufficient. RE techniques for SoS must support iterating, changing, synchronizing, and communicating requirements across different abstraction and hierarchy levels as well as scopes of responsibility. [Question/Problem] We address the challenge of SoS requirements specification, where requirements can describe the SoS behavior, but also the behavior of CSs that are developed independently. [Principal Ideas] To support the requirements specification in an SoS environment, we propose a scenario-based and iterative specification technique. This allows requirements engineers to continuously model and jointly execute and test the system behavior for the SoS and the CS in order to detect contradictions in the requirement specifications at an early stage. [Contribution] In this paper, we describe an extension for the scenario-modeling language for Kotlin (SMLK) to continuously and formally model requirements on SoS and CS level. To support the iterative requirements specification and modeling we combine SMLK with agile development techniques. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with the help of an example from the field of e-mobility. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-73128-1_12,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-73128-1_12,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar

2012,Evolving robust networks for systems-of-systems,"Software systems that rely on ad-hoc networks are becoming increasingly complex and increasingly prevalent. Some of these systems provide vital functionality to military operations, emergency services and disaster relief; such systems may have significant impact on the safety of people involved in those operations. It is therefore important that those networks support critical software requirements, including those for latency of packet transfer. If a network ceases to meet the software's requirements (e.g. due to a link failure) then engineers must be able to understand it well enough to reconfigure the network and restore it to a requirement-satisfying state. Given a complex network, it is difficult for a human to do this under time pressure. In this paper we present a search-based tool which takes a network defined using the Network Description Language (NDL), annotated with a set of network-hosted applications and a set of latency requirements between each. We then evolve variants of the network configuration which meet the requirements and are robust to single link failures. We use network calculus tools to get a fast, conservative evaluation of whether a given network meets its requirements. We demonstrate that this approach is viable, designs networks much faster than a human engineer could, and is superior to a random generate-and-test approach. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/978-3-642-33119-0_4,,scopus; springerlink

2021,Challenges in providing sustainable analytic of system of systems with long life time,"Embedded systems are today often self-sufficient systems with limited communication. However, this traditional view of an embedded system is changing rapidly. Embedded systems are nowadays evolving, e.g., an evolution pushed by the increased functional gain introduced with the concept of System of Systems (SoS) that is connecting multiple subsystems to achieve a combined functionality and/or information of a higher value. In such a SoS the subsystems will have to serve a dual purpose in a) the initial purpose that the subsystem was originally designed and deployed for, e.g., control and protection of the physical assets of a critical infrastructure system that could be up and running for 30-40 years, and b) at the same time provide information to a higher-level system for a potential future increase of system functionality as technology matures and/or new opportunities are provided by, e.g., greater analytics capabilities. In this paper, within the context of a “dual purpose use” of a) and b), we bring up three central challenges related to i) information gathering, ii) life-cycle management, and iii) data governance, and we propose directions for solutions to these challenges that need to be evaluated already at design time.",10.1109/SOSE52739.2021.9497465,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2021,Heterogeneous Cyber Physical Systems of Systems,"Cyber-physical systems are the natural extension of the so-called “Internet of Things”. They are “systems of collaborating computational elements controlling physical entities.” Cyber Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) are considered “The Next Computing Revolution” after Mainframe computing (60‘s-70‘s), Desktop computing & Internet (80‘s-90‘s) and Ubiquitous computing (00‘s); because all aspects of daily life are rapidly evolving towards humans interacting among themselves as well as their environment via computational devices (often mobile), and because in most cases systems will employ their computational capabilities to interact among themselves. CPSoS enable the physical world to merge with the cyber one. Using sensors, the embedded systems monitor and collect data from physical processes, such as the steering of a vehicle, energy consumption, or human health functions. The systems are networked making the data globally available. CPSoS make it possible for software applications to directly interact with events in the physical world, for example to measure and react to changes in blood pressure or peaks in energy consumption. Embedded hardware and software systems crucially expand the functionality and competitiveness of vehicles, aircraft, medical equipment, production plants and household appliances. Connecting these systems to a virtual environment of globally networked services and information systems opens completely new areas of innovation and novel business platforms. Future CPSoS will have many sophisticated, interconnected parts that must instantaneously exchange, parse, and act on detailed data in a highly coordinated manner. Continued advances in science and engineering will be necessary to enable advances in design and development of these complex systems. Multi-scale, multi-layer, multi-domain, and multi-system integrated infrastructures will require new foundations in system science and engineering. Scientists and engineers with an understanding of otherwise physical systems will need to work in tandem with computer and information scientists to achieve effective, workable designs. In this tutorial, basic and advanced issues on the design of the future heterogeneous CPSoS are presented including relevant Blockchain technologies, reconfigurable systems, advanced sensor interfaces and human-centered design processes.

2021,Transdisciplinary Approach in Studying Organisational Transformations: A case study in Evolution of Military Enterprises,"Digital transformation has a notorious record of failures. Maybe the enterprise architects do not have a holistic model to study and model the organisational transformation. An enterprise consists of several structural components, which vary from culture to technology layers defined in the Enterprise Architecture. Usually, the transformation of an enterprise involves most of the interrelated layers in connection to the environment around the organisation. Seemingly, no single science provides frameworks to study the transformation of a whole system of systems (including the layers of enterprise strategy, culture, business, information, and technology). Therefore, the paper proposes a transdisciplinary approach combined with spiral research design as a framework for the business sciences and enterprise architecture. The proposed framework connects different sciences of sociology, business, strategy, history, information, and technology to understand the evolutionary particularities of each layer of enterprise in transformation. The transdisciplinary approach supports the modelling of the entire enterprise in all of its complexities and over a longer time. In contrast, the current monodisciplinary focuses only on parts of an enterprise at a particular window of time. By definition, transdisciplinary research fuses findings across the disciplines, between the disciplines and beyond the disciplines. Furthermore, the framework supports spiralling between scientific methods and non-scientific practices. The case study utilised a spiralling research process that provided a tighter feedback loop from application in practice to model development in theory. The transdisciplinary spiralling approach provided an iterative approach to verify the outcome, reduce the complexity, and address the practitioner’s reality. Hopefully, the research approach used in the case study and the tool created will improve enterprise architecture practice to ensure a successful digital transformation of military organisations. © The authors, 2021.

2016,Software architecture challenges and emerging research in software-intensive systems-of-systems,"Software-intensive systems are often independently developed, operated, managed, and evolved. Progressively, communication networks enabled these independent systems to interact, yielding a new kind of complex system, i.e. a system that is itself composed of systems, the so-called System-of-Systems (SoS). By its very nature, SoS is evolutionarily developed and exhibits emergent behavior. Actually, software architecture research has mainly focused on single systems, mostly large or very large distributed systems whose software architecture is described as design-time configurations of components linked together through connectors. However, it is well known that the restricted characteristics of single (even very large distributed) systems lead to architectural solutions (in terms of theories, languages, tools, and methods) that do not scale up to the case of systems-of-systems. Indeed, novel architectural solutions are needed to handle the complexity of software-intensive systems-of-systems in particular regarding the software architecture challenges implied by evolutionary development and emergent behavior. This paper presents the challenges facing software architecture research to address software-intensive systems-of-systems.

2019,Architecting systems-of-systems and their constituents: A case study applying Industry 4.0 in the construction domain,"Abstract The development of system-of-systems (SoS) requires a continuous interplay between design decisions on the SoS level and those on the level of its constituent systems (CS), which often preexist and need to be adapted as the SoS evolves. This involves not only preparing the CS to participate in a particular SoS, but also designing the CS architecture to make it easily adaptable to a future SoS context. The problem is in part addressed in an emerging SoS framework in the manufacturing domain called Industry 4.0. It focuses on connected and digitalized production with the ambition of increasing flexibility and efficiency. This paper investigates how Industry 4.0 standards can be used in an SoS context to make CS more flexible and adaptive, and evaluates their usefulness outside manufacturing. The study is based on a case from the construction domain, for which a generic SoS architecture is developed. Several extensions and adaptations of Industry 4.0 are suggested, including specifications of ontologies for missions and workflows.",10.1002/sys.21516,,wiley

2020,Automated reasoning framework for traceability management of system of systems,"An important aspect in system of systems (SoS) is the realization of the capabilities in different systems that work together. Identifying and locating these capabilities are important to orchestrate the overall activities and hereby to achieve the overall goal of the SoS. System elements and capabilities in SoS however, are rarely stable and need to evolve in different ways and different times in accordance with the changing requirements. To manage the SoS and cope with its evolution it is necessary that the dependency links to the capabilities and the system elements can be easily traced. Several approaches have been proposed to model traceability and reason about these by extending a predetermined set of possible trace links with fixed semantics. However, for the context of SoS a fixed traceability model with fixed traceability semantics is limited to consider the various different and changing scenarios. In this article, we first present the different traceability requirements for managing traceability in the context of SoS. Subsequently, we present the metamodel and the corresponding domain specific language to support modeling traceability and traceability analysis approaches within the evolving SoS context. Further, we provide the tool support for automated reasoning of traceability of SoS capabilities and system elements. We illustrate and discuss the approach for the application to a smart city SoS.",10.1016/j.scico.2020.102416,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience
2020,Extended Enterprise Collaboration for System-of-Systems Requirements Engineering: Challenges in the Era of COVID-19,"Given the complexity and evolutionary nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS) entailing frequently changing goals and requirements, Extended Enterprise Collaboration (EEC) is needed. The idea behind EEC consists in teaming up with other stakeholders in partnerships in order to manage the skills, risks and investments required to rush the product to market. However, collaboration is far from being trivial, as it is constrained by several challenges such as heterogeneity of stakeholders and their ways of working - let alone global crisis like COVID-19. Thus, an overview of these challenges from both academic and industrial perspectives would be beneficial. With this in mind, based on a survey, this paper provides a comprehensive overview that goes beyond the challenges, to consider the benefits of, methods for, barriers and bridges to efficient collaboration. The survey was conducted among research-active academics in the field of SoS engineering, and companies in the US and European aerospace and defense industries. On the one hand, the results show that in response to COVID-19, work agreements (clear policies, commonly used processes and procedures, tools interoperability, clarity around roles and responsibilities of each collaborating firm, and proper change communication) are required in order to reduce uncertainty. On the other hand, it was revealed that “human bridges” are the backbone of EEC. It is, indeed, human factors that either impede or promote efficient collaboration. An important finding that comes in agreement with recent calls for shifting the focus from “technology-centered” to “human-centered” SoS engineering. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",10.1007/978-3-030-63479-7_26,,scopus; springerlink
2019,Towards intelligent architecting of aerospace system-of-systems,"System-of-Systems (SoS) are composed of large scale independent and complex heterogeneous systems which collaborate to create capabilities not achievable by a single system, for example air transportation system, satellite constellations, and space exploration architectures. Much of the research effort in the field of SoS has focused on the analysis of these complex entities, while there are still major gaps in developing tools for automated synthesis and engineering of SoS that consider all the various aspects in this problem domain. The gap we address in this paper is a mapping of clusters of SoS architecture alternatives, segmented by performance along multiple metrics, to architectural features. Building upon our previous research where we used a SoS Analytic Work Bench in combination with Model-Based Systems Engineering artifacts to perform analysis of aerospace systems, we propose to build a process for intelligent architecting of aerospace SoS. This process discovers and employs pertinent features in a complex design space to effectively meet the user needs, elevating SoS engineering from retrospective architectural analysis to automated synthesis of new architectures. As a first step towards intelligent architecture of aerospace SoS, we propose to utilize Machine Learning techniques to automate the synthesis phase of SoS. Our hypothesis is that a set of holistic metrics of aerospace architectures (cost, performance, robustness, operational risk, average delay, etc.) can be used to characterize a measure of goodness of architectures, with good architectures on a Pareto front of the multi-dimensional space of holistic metrics of interest. Each architecture or cluster may be then mapped to a set of architectural features, with the goal of identifying which features belong to good architectures. Specifically, we propose to utilize non-parametric regression on a set of training architectures (for example, Neural Networks can deal with mixed real and integer variables) to associate each one with a pattern of features. This mapping will allow the automated process to predict what metrics will be expected from SoS architectures with specific features, and therefore to automatically synthesize architectures that exhibit desired characteristics of goodness. For example, for constellations of satellites, a group of good architecture might have medium cost, high resilience, medium robustness, and low risk, and the architectural features to be mapped to each group can include number of satellites, number of components, type of orbit, type of power system, etc. Since the environment constantly evolves, architectures must adapt, and stochastic optimization can be used to switch between architectures with minimal effort. In this work we illustrate the new version of our aerospace SoS analysis and synthesis framework, which includes Machine Learning techniques to support synthesis of SoS architectures. We demonstrate the application of this process on satellite constellations and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8742173/,googlescholar
2019,Software mediators as first-class entities of systems-of-systems software architectures,"Context: In contrast to traditional software systems that are mostly created from scratch, current software systems are engineered as a junction of systems already in operation. Examples can be found in domains, such as smart cities, crisis and emergency, IoT, big data, industry 4.0, and connected health systems. Most of them can be considered systems-of-systems (SoS), since they refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, which are sometimes distributed over different environments. Therefore, SoS software architectures must be dynamic, evolve over time, and support the execution of emergent behaviors to accomplish SoS missions. They must be also designed to enable the connection of heterogeneous systems, making possible their interoperation, communication, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration, most of the times, in a seamless way. Similar challenges have been addressed by using software mediators as architectural entities. However, the application of mediators in SoS has not been properly explored. Goal: This article introduces MediArch, a layered architecture that considers mediators as first-class software entities to be used in the construction of SoS architectures. Our objective is to present evidence about how MediArch’s can support the construction of SoS architectures. Methods: The following four steps were conducted to define MediArch: (1) identification of mediation requirements to allow SoS properties; (2) establishment and categorization of twelve types of mediators, for enabling capabilities of communication and control of constituent systems interactions and conversion of heterogeneous messages exchanged through a mediation infrastructure; (3) specification of duties, behaviors, assumptions, and guarantees of mediators; and (4) organization of MediArch in three layers, namely, the constituents & consumer systems layer; the communication, conversion, & coordination layer; and the control layer. This architecture was used as the backbone for the software architectures of two SoS in different domains, namely, flood monitoring system-of-systems (FMSoS), and health-care supportive home system-of-systems (HSH-SoS), for providing evidence on how MediArch supports the architecting process of SoS. Results: MediArch (1) supports the integration of independent constituent systems, (2) provides strategies to manage emergent behaviors, (3) defines different schemes of control authorities, (4) offers elements to support SoS evolution, and (5) promotes the resilience and adaptability of SoS architectures. Conclusions: Although MediArch contributes to the establishment of SoS architectures, some challenges related to performance, resource consumption, security, safety, and non-disruptive reconfigurations must still be overcome. © 2019, The Author(s).",10.1186/s13173-019-0089-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13173-019-0089-3,scopus; springerlink; googlescholar
2019,Risk-informed decision-making in asset management as a complex adaptive system of systems,"Decision-making is an essential activity in asset management (AM). It is influenced by various factors (strategic, technical/technological, economic, organisational, regulatory, safety, markets, etc.). Sound decision-making in AM ought to take into account relevant factors in order to balance risks, opportunities, performance, costs and benefits. Additionally, modern organisations evolve in complex operational and business environments and are exposed to significant uncertainties. In such a context, decision-making in AM becomes more challenging. This study proposes a holistic three-step risk-informed decision-making (RIDM) methodology developed for AM, where RIDM is considered a complex adaptive system of systems. The methodology is applied in a case study to analyse possible modification strategies for a nuclear power plant's emergency core cooling system. Through the RIDM process, quantitative models and other factors have been taken into account in order to obtain the necessary comprehensive insights regarding the decision to be made.",10.1504/IJSEAM.2019.108468,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJSEAM.2019.108468,googlescholar
2019,Governing Regression Testing in Systems of Systems,"Great advances in network technology and software engineering have triggered the development and spread of Systems of Systems (SoSs). The dynamic and evolvable nature of SoSs poses important challenges on the validation of such systems and in particular on their regression testing, aiming at assessing that run-time changes and evolutions do not introduce regression in SoS behavior. This paper outlines issues and challenges of regression testing of SoSs, identifying the main kinds of evolution that can impact on their regression testing activity. Furthermore, it presents a conceptual framework for governing the regression testing of SoSs. The proposed framework leverages the concept of an orchestration graph that describes the flow of test cases and sketches a solution for deriving a regression test plan according to test cases dependencies.",10.1109/ISSREW.2019.00064,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2005,Understanding transportation as system-of-systems design problem,"The purposes of this paper are to introduce an emerging class of problems called system-of-systems, present the primary traits of the class, and then described the relevant implications for the aerospace design community. Two primary traits, evolutionary and emergent behavior, are highlighted since they call attention to a network-of-systems, dynamic-behavior focus as opposed to an individual system, static-behavior focus. Further, methodological needs for investigation of these traits lie outside present capability in the community. To explore these implications in depth, the casting of future transportation concepts as a system-of-systems is described. A recently developed ""proto-method"" for this class of problems is presented and explored in the context of the transportation domain, including promising approaches for building effective modeling and simulation. The casting of civil transportation as a system-of-systems problem is important as much of the literature on system-of-systems (limited as it is) resides primarily in the defense systems domain.",,,scopus
2013,The State of the Art and Future Perspectives in Systems of Systems Software Architectures,"Currently, software systems have become increasingly large and complex, often resulted by the integration of several operationally independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems: the Systems of Systems (SoS). In another perspective, software architectures play a major role in determining system quality, since they form the backbone of any successful software-intensive system. Attention given to the software architectures of SoS is also certainly fundamental to the success of such systems. However, it is observed that there is a lack of works that present a wide and, at the same time, a detailed panorama about how SoS architectures have been treated. In this scenario, the main contribution of this paper is to present the state of the art on software architectures of SoS, mainly regarding their development, representation, evaluation, and evolution. This work also contributes with future research topics on SoS architectures that should be still investigated.

2017,Order beyond chaos: Introducing the notion of generation to characterize the continuously evolving implementations of cyber-physical systems,"Authors belonging to different institutions ('schools') of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) research and development report on largely different objectives, underpin their work with different theories and methodologies, and target characteristics which can actually better characterize other categories and families of engineered systems. This has resulted in an ontological chaos. Therefore, our research addressed the question: What exists in the form of past, current and future CPSs? Our hypothesis has been that we can have an ordered picture on the landscape of CPSs by introducing the notion of system generation. Generation is a structural term defined as a 'technological/engineering cohort' of different individual manifestation of systems that reflect genotypic features of ancestor systems belonging to the same category, but deviates from them with regards to their phenotypic features. Based on our literature findings, we have defined five generations of CPSs, which could be differentiated based on: (i) the level of self-intelligence, and (ii) the level of self-organization. The zeroth generation includes look-Alikes and partial implementations of CPS. The 1G-CPSs include systems with self-regulation and self-Tuning capabilities, while the 2G-CPSs are capable to operationalize self-Awareness and selfadaptation. The 3G-CPSs are equipped with the capabilities of self-cognizance and self-evolution. According to our reasoning model, only the fourth generation of CPSs is supposed to achieve self-consciousness and self-reproduction in the form of system of systems. The paper analyses the major paradigmatic characteristics of these generations. It also provides an outlook to the trends that may have strong influence on the introduced generations of CPSs. © 2017 ASME.",10.1115/DETC2017-67082,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-abstract/IDETC-CIE2017/V001T02A015/259144,scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2019,Evolution Model of Equipment Support Network Considering Interdependent Relationship; [考虑节点相依关系的装备保障网络演化模型],"With the continuous evolution of equipment support system of systems from traditional hierarchical tree structure to complex network structure, the original research methods and evolution laws can not solve the multi-network evolution problems encountered well. Based on the interdependence among different sub-network nodes, the theory of interdependent network is applied to the evolutionary analysis of equipment support network. The network characteristics of equipment support system of systems are analyzed, and the measures of network robustness are defined based on the maximal connected subgraph and network support efficiency. In the network evolution model, the evolution rules and steps of the model are determined according to the equipment support mechanism, the network interdependency proportional parameter F, which represents the proportion of maintenance, storage and supply nodes with interaction, and the interdependence redundancy parameter K, which represents the average number between some maintenance node and its neighbors in storage and supply network, are defined, and their effects on network robustness are analyzed through simulation. The simulated results of evolution model show that the robustness and overall support efficiency of interdependent network can be improved by controlling the parameters K and F. © 2019, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii.

2018,Threat Analysis in Systems-of-Systems: An Emergence-Oriented Approach,"Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (SoSs) are large-scale systems made of independent and autonomous cyber-physical Constituent Systems (CSs) which may interoperate to achieve high-level goals also with the intervention of humans. Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators. The proposed methodology, as well as the tool, is empirically validated on Smart Grid case studies by submitting questionnaires to a user base composed of 3 stakeholders and 18 BSc and MSc students.",10.1145/3234513,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3234513,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2019,Using Bayesian Networks for a Cyberattacks Propagation Analysis in Systems-of-Systems,"System of Systems (SoS) represent a set of independent Constituent Systems (CS) that collaborate in order to provide functionalities that they are unable to achieve independently. We consider SoS as a set of connected services that needs to be adequately protected. The integration of these independent, evolutionary and distributed systems, intensifies SoS complexity and emphasizes the behavior uncertainty, which makes an SoS security analysis a critical challenge. One of the major priorities when designing SoS, is to analyze the unknown dependencies among CS services and vulnerabilities leading to potential cyberattacks. The aim of this work is to investigate how Software Engineering approaches could be leveraged to analyze the cyberattack propagation problem within an SoS. Such analysis is essential for an efficient SoS risk assessment performed early at the SoS design phase and required to protect the SoS from possibly high impact attacks affecting its safety and security. In order to achieve our objective, we present a model-driven analysis approach, based on Bayesian Networks, a sensitivity analysis and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) with aim to discover potential cyberattacks propagation and estimate the probability of a security failure and its impact on SoS services.

Functional aspects, guiding SoSs to accomplish their global goals, are handled via a functional specification. Multilevel aspects are modeled with the Influence Reaction Model for Multilevel Simulation (IRM4MLS) agent-based meta-model. Models generated using this formalism encompass static and dynamic aspects of SoSs. They consider reorganization of SoSs caused by changes of goals or subsystem capacity.

2018,Formally describing self-organizing architectures for systems-of-systems on the internet-of-things,"Nowadays, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) enables the engineering of Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems (SoS), which are opportunistically created for achieving specified missions in specific operational environments. A challenging issue in the architectural design of SoS on IoT is to conceive concepts and mechanisms for describing how an SoS architecture is able to create, on the fly, emergent behaviors from elementary IoT systems/devices. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the theory of self-organization, which makes possible that, in an SoS, its constituent systems spontaneously create and maintain a valid SoS architecture enabling the evolutionary development of the required emergent behavior to fulfill the specified SoS mission. In particular, it describes how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), based on the novel π-Calculus for SoS, was enhanced to support the architectural description of self-organizing SoSs on the IoT, upwardly causing SoS emergent behaviors at run-time. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_2,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar

2016,System-of-systems support—A bigraph approach to interoperability and emergent behavior,"
                  When designing highly interactive distributed systems such as e-learning environments, a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective enables dynamic adaptation to situations of use and thus user-centeredness during operation. Each system, e.g., a mobile device for accessing a learning management system, can still be operated as a separate system, e.g., displaying the latest feedback from peers, while being run as part of a federated system, e.g., synchronizing a learning group for a tutoring session taking into account individual availability of participants. This type of coupling requires interoperability assurance of systems, in particular federating various devices and cross-over features (e.g., linking learning content to posts on social media platforms) in dynamically evolving environments. We demonstrate the utility of bigraph-based handling of SoS. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the re-specification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We show the potential of this approach orchestrating two distributed and independent systems, with orchestration enabling directly respondence to changes in a federated system's context.

2018,Learning Framework For Maturing Architecture Design Decisions For Evolving Complex SoS,"Architecting a complex System-of-Systems (SoS) poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty and perceptions associated with understanding the implications of constituent system’s architecture design decisions at SoS level. Due to significant knowledge gaps, architects may find it difficult to uncover the ramifications of a specific decision on various Measures-of-Effectiveness (MOEs) and emergent behavior of the SoS. Subsequently, for complex SoS, learning cycles maybe experienced on the architecture design decisions. As the SoS evolves, these experiential learnings need to be factored into the uncertainty assessments of decisions and the impacted SoS MOEs, while evaluating and deciding on a specific decision. This paper proposes a knowledge based decision learning framework that factors the learning cycles experienced into the uncertainty associated with the decisions and impacted SoS MOEs. The framework takes into consideration, through an architectural knowledge base, multiple knowledge dimensions such as the attributes of the architecture design decision and the feedback loops experienced, in tandem with the complexity attributes and the knowledge gaps associated with the decision.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428733,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2018,A Novel “Resilience Viewpoint” to aid in Engineering Resilience in Systems of Systems (SoS),"Abstract Designing evolutionary systems to meet stakeholder expectations on safety, reliability and overall resilience is of great importance in an age of interconnectivity and high dependency systems. With incidents and disruptions becoming more frequent in recent years, the requirement for systems to demonstrate high levels of resilience given the economic, political and temporal dimensions of complexity, resilience is of great significance today. Systemic resilience is of high importance at the global level. Therefore, the role of the system engineer and architect is becoming more demanding due to the need to consider requirements from a broader range of stakeholders and to implement them into early conceptual designs. The early modeling process of all systems is common ground for most engineering projects, creating an architecture to both understand a system and to design future iterations by applying model-based processes has become the norm. With the concept of systems-of-systems (SoS) becoming common language across multiple engineering domains, model-based systems engineering techniques are evolving hand-in-hand to provide a paradigm to better analyse current and future SoS. The intrinsic characteristics of the constituent systems that make up the SoS make the challenge of designing and maintaining the reliability and resilience of a systems extremely difficult. This paper proposes a novel viewpoint, within an architecture framework (based around DoDAF, MoDAF and UPDM) to aid systems architects explore and design resilient SoS. This is known as the Resilience Viewpoint. Much of the research in the area is focussed on critical infrastructure (CI), looking at telecommunication networks, electric grid, supply networks etc, and little has been done on a generalizable tool for SoS architecture analysis, especially using existing modeling languages. Here, the application of the ‘Resilience Viewpoint’ is demonstrated using a case study from an integrated water supply system of systems, to portray its potential analytical capabilities.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2018.00519.x,,wiley

Runtime monitoring approaches are thus used to detect deviations from the expected behavior, which is commonly defined by engineers, e.g., using temporal logic or domain-specific languages. However, the deep domain knowledge required to specify constraints is often not available during the development of systems of systems with multiple teams independently working on heterogeneous components. In this paper, we thus describe our ongoing PhD research to automatically mine constraints for runtime monitoring from recorded events. Our approach mines constraints on event occurrence, timing, data, and combinations of these properties. The approach further presents the mined constraints to users offering multiple ranking strategies and can also be used to support users in system evolution scenarios.",10.1145/3238147.3241532,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

A concrete example is discussed composed of two cooperating component systems, an unmanned aerial vehicle and an intelligent autonomous road vehicle, in which the unmanned aerial vehicle acts as an external global positioning system sensor that supplies redundant navigation information to the intelligent autonomous road vehicle, to be able to safely maneuver in a confined space.",10.1109/ACIT.2018.8672676,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2018,Modeling and Robust Optimization for System of Systems Problems under Uncertainty,"The paper proposes a novel idea for how to model and optimize uncertain problems of system of systems (SoS). Firstly, the background and necessity on researching SoS and its robust optimization under uncertainty are introduced. Secondly, preparatory models are constructed to model the aggregations and cooperation among SoS and are regarded as the main body of further studies. Subsequently, a scenario-based model to formulate uncertainties and a Markov-based model to simulate uncertainty evolutions of SoS are introduced. Then, a novel idea for how to solving robust optimization under uncertainties in single-stage and multi-stage is proposed. The methods of the researches can be applied to solve SoS problems under uncertainty in real world, such as transportation systems planning, power grid systems operation and competition considered financial cooperation etc. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/CCSSE.2018.8724800,,scopus
2014,System of Systems and Big Data analytics – Bridging the gap,"Large data has been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for quite some time. Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of “Big Data”. System of Systems (SoS) integrate independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today’s SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable “Big Data”. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation (such as genetic algorithms), Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to (a) extract information, (b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and (c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”. This paper demonstrates how to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. The subject material for this demonstration is using data analytics to generate a model to forecast produced photovoltaic energy to assist in the optimization of a micro grid SoS. Tools like fuzzy interference, neural networks, PCA, and genetic algorithms are used.",10.1016/j.compeleceng.2013.11.016,,sciencedirect
2018,Modelling and simulation of system-of-systems using P-systems theory,"This paper connects two independent fields of research - system-of-systems (SoS) and P-systems. P-systems, originally inspired by basic features of biological membranes, where objects are placed into compartments defined by a membrane structure, and evolve according to reaction rules. Systems that belong to a particular level in the hierarchy of a SoS are can be understood to be within a membrane of certain depth. Also, objects in P-systems evolve in a maximally parallel, non-deterministic manner, a preferred method of evolution for many intractable SoS problems. Transitions of individual systems to other systems, or to alternative configurations can be easily realised using the format of P-systems. By casting typical SoS problems into P-system representations, we demonstrate the ease of problem set up, and the possibility of solving commonly intractable SoS modelling and simulation problems in feasible time. An example problem involving communication between aircraft is studied to illustrate the applicability of P-systems theory to SoS.

2017,System-of-systems design thinking on behavior,"Due to the increasing digitalization of all societal systems, informed design of services and systems becomes pertinent for various stakeholders. This paper discusses the design of digital systems in a user-centered way with the help of subject-oriented design. The approach follows a communication-driven and network-centric perspective on a System-of-Systems, whereby system specifications encapsulate behavior and exchange messages, including relevant data, such as business objects. Systems can represent activities of human actors, as well as artefacts. Stakeholders can be actively involved in their roles in the design of a System-of-Systems. In the course of design, they identify and refine role-specific behavior, based on communication to other actors or systems. A System-of-Systems specification evolves as a network of cooperating behavior entities. It develops according to communication needs and system-specific capabilities, on the level of synchronized execution agents, or as an overlay mechanism on existing applications or sub networks. Since certain behavior sequences, such as decision-making procedures, are re-occurring in organizations or eco-systems, the design of complex systems can be facilitated by behavior patterns stemming from existing modeling experiences.",,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/5/1/3,googlescholar
2016,The electric road system transition from a system to a system-of-systems,"Electric roads have had a pleasant journey through the research landscape but are now about to enter the “valley of death.” The basic technologies for dynamic power transfer from the road to vehicles in motion has been developed through various research projects across the globe, largely supported by public funding. Electric road systems (ERS) will soon be tested on public roads, but is still a long way from constituting a large-scale commercial system. While ERS has gained recognition as a technological solution, few studies address the necessary system transition from a holistic perspective. This article addresses this gap by presenting the state of the art of ERS and examining future use case scenarios and stakeholder implications. The purpose of this article is accordingly to examine how ERS not only constitutes a technical development challenge, but also radically increases technical, business, and systems complexity. This article illustrates how ERS will likely evolve from a system to a system of systems and the likely changes in the business and system architecture occurring during this transformation will be analyzed.

2015,Enabling emergent behavior in systems-of-systems through bigraph-based modeling,"Today, software systems tend to be split into multiple components that can operate, both, autonomously and in a networked way, in order to pursue a common objective. Such a polymorph approach to system architectures requires novel specification techniques. A system-of-systems conceptualization enables addressing emergent behavior, while letting the involved components and systems operate independently of each other. This property requires system interoperability and can be achieved by bigraph-based modeling. A flexible abstraction mechanism as well as a strong typing of system interaction enable system interoperability in evolutionary environments. Consequently, the composition and decomposition of bigraph-based models support the emergence of novel behavior. We evaluate the potential of this approach based on its capability to represent system-of-systems according to the distinguishing characteristics proposed by Boardman and Sauser as well as by orchestrating two independent systems.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2015.7151954,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7151954/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Looking at how each generation of a system changes as an evolutionary process, one can see correlations with the natural evolution process. Using nature as a guide, biological models may be a means to assess an engineered system and propose anticipatory changes (evolutions) to a current system to create the next generation. This idea of systems generational evolution may provide insight into the design process of multigenerational systems to be more adaptable to changing technology.

2015,Simulation of Kanban-based Scheduling for Systems of Systems: Initial Results,"Systems engineering processes for evolving systems of systems (SoS) are often software-driven and software-intensive. At the same time, SoS have multiple levels of abstraction that correspond to the various levels in the SoS hierarchy where these SoS engineering processes take place. Multiple levels of management make it difficult to capture the actual state and relative value of work in these kinds of environments. The Kanban-based scheduling system (KSS) applies lean concepts to coordinate work queues to better to address these issues. The motivation to apply agile methodologies in multi-organizational multi-level environments is based on lean principles that encourage increased visibility of work in progress, limited work in progress, and identification of issues causing blocked work. Current research is focused on formulating the KSS principles and estimating expected performance of the KSS.

At the same time, growing attention is given to the need for establishing a sound foundation for the field of systems engineering, with the development of the appropriate theories and methods, which require effectiveness definitions and metrics, among others. This paper introduces the concept of receding capabilities of a system of system, as a necessary building block to further complement and develop the foundation of systems engineering.

2017,Towards Environmental Analytics: DPSIR as a System of Systems,"DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, States, Impacts, Responses) is a framework addressing the needs of environmental data reporting and assessment, extensively exploited by the European Union, its Member States and associated countries. The DPSIR framework does not model the environment, however it implies a systems model. Making such model explicit allows users to better understand the semantics of the five DPSIR components, therefore improving the harmonization and quality of the reported data, in particular in order to process them as Big Data. To such purpose, the tools provided by the systems theory are useful, specifically the system-of-systems (SoS) point of view. On such basis, a conceptual model of the relationships between the constituent systems of the socio-ecological system (SES) is proposed. As a result of such analysis some possible evolutions of DPSIR are envisaged, in terms of expanded and refined environmental data flows. Such evolutions aim to build a better integrated environmental knowledge base, as a prerequisite to a wider exploitation of analytics for the relevant decision processes and management activities.",10.1007/978-3-319-44711-7_29,,springerlink

2016,Synergies of System-of-Systems and Microservices Architectures,"Systems-of-Systems (SoS) are being widely embraced by both practitioners and researchers. They share properties such as distribution, evolutionary development (i.e., openness), operational and managerial independence, and emergent behavior. Those properties imply that any element (system) in an SoS is able to operate independently. Similarly, microservices are suggested as a system architecture with a strong emphasis on independence, as containers provide the required degree of isolation, and their infrastructure automation frameworks provide the means to deploy them as needed. In a microservices architecture, even data is independently managed; every service maintains its own datastore, and transaction-less interaction is emphasized. Our hypothesis in this work is that while the two approaches have been treated separately in the literature so far, they share many common characteristics, and it would be fruitful to investigate their synergies. In this paper, we analyze to what extent microservices architectures can be understood as a kind of system-of-systems, explaining some of the success of the microservices approach a consequence of their SoS properties. In addition, the best practices proposed for microservices can enable a conscious, controlled, and manageable introduction of SoS concepts into system architectures, if they are needed.",10.1145/3175731.3176176,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3175731.3176176,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

2016,Risk Assessment of Infrastructure System of Systems with Precursor Analysis,"Physical infrastructure systems are commonly composed of interconnected and interdependent subsystems, which in their essence constitute system of systems (S-o-S). System owners and policy researchers need tools to foresee potential emergent forced changes and to understand their impact so that effective risk management strategies can be developed. We develop a systemic framework for precursor analysis to support the design of an effective and efficient precursor monitoring and decision support system with the ability to (i) identify and prioritize indicators of evolving risks of system failure; and (ii) evaluate uncertainties in precursor analysis to support informed and rational decision making. This integrated precursor analysis framework is comprised of three processes: precursor identification, prioritization, and evaluation. We use an example of a highway bridge S-o-S to demonstrate the theories and methodologies of the framework. Bridge maintenance processes involve many interconnected and interdependent functional subsystems and decision-making entities and bridge failure can have broad social and economic consequences. The precursor analysis framework, which constitutes an essential part of risk analysis, examines the impact of various bridge inspection and maintenance scenarios. It enables policy researchers and analysts who are seeking a risk perspective on bridge infrastructure in a policy setting to develop more risk informed policies and create guidelines to efficiently allocate limited risk management resources and mitigate severe consequences resulting from bridge failures. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis",10.1111/risa.12559,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2016,Computational intelligence based complex adaptive system-of-system architecture evolution strategy,"There is a constant challenge to incorporate new systems and upgrade existing systems under threats, constrained budget and uncertainty into systems of systems (SoS). It is necessary for program managers to be able to assess the impacts of future technology and stakeholder changes. This research helps analyze sequential decisions in an evolving SoS architecture through three key features: SoS architecture generation, assessment and implementation through negotiation. Architectures are generated using evolutionary algorithms and assessed using type II fuzzy nets. The approach accommodates diverse stakeholder views, converting them to key performance parameters (KPPs) for architecture assessment. It is not possible to implement an acknowledged SoS architecture without persuading the systems to participate. A negotiation model is proposed to help the SoS manger adapt his strategy based on system owners’ behavior. Viewpoints of multiple stakeholders are aggregated to assess the overall mission effectiveness of an architecture against the overarching objectives.

Principles of network science and multiagent simulation applied in concert form the core of the simulation. While the representations of the individual systems are basic, the higher level approach allows for new ways to optimize at the aggregated network level, determining the best topology (i.e., configuration of nodes and links).

2016,Interface design in cyber-physical Systems-of-Systems,"A Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems (CPSoS) is a possibly huge information processing and energy transforming system. Its autonomous Constituent Systems (CSs), i.e., computer systems, and optionally physical systems and humans, interact in their common environment to realize often mutually beneficial emergent CPSoS services. Many key challenges in understanding, designing, and engineering such CPSoSs are related to the interactions of CSs. This paper conceptualizes these interactions of CSs, i.e., their interfaces, at three abstraction levels: cyberphysical, Itom, and service. The cyber-physical level concernes message-based interactions in cyber space, and stigmergic interactions in the physical environment. The Itom level involves the description of direct and indirect information transfers. The service level helps to tackle challenges related to the dynamicity and evolution of CPSoSs. The second part of the paper discusses design aspects of Relied Upon Interfaces (RUIs) which are the interfaces the overall emergent CPSoS service relies upon. The conceptualization of interfaces in CPSoSs and the proposed RUI design aspects are intended to simplify the modeling of CPSoSs and to facilitate their deployment with existing Internet-of-Things and cloud technologies.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2016.7542924,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2013,Using Architecture Patterns to Architect and Analyze Systems of Systems,"The inherent nature of a Systems of Systems (SoS) makes it very difficult to model and analyze it through conventional means. One of the first challenges faced is how to represent the SoS in a form that lends itself to detailed analysis, especially when full details of the component systems may not be readily available. Therefore, an important consideration is whether use of model abstractions can be sufficient to deal with many of the analysis needs of the SoS. It is clear there is a need for a new paradigm, encompassing methodology, models, tools and flows that enable the future engineering of SoS in order that they can be operated effectively. This paper describes how we are using architecture patterns to architect and analyze SoS in order that we can compare different architecture solutions and provide guidelines for the development of a future architectures based on the analysis of existing architectures. Insights are given to show the benefits for SoS architecture analysis with exemplars taken from a test case dealing with emergency response for a major incident in the UK.

Because most of the master plans are developed by an authority with significant control, which might not be true in a SoS environment. Different stakeholders might have conflicting master plans that require communication, negotiation and coordination. We propose a decentralized multi-stakeholder decision making framework where local stakeholders conduct acquisition development planning for individual benefits while the SoS-level stakeholder designs a coordination mechanism to facilitate the communication between stakeholders and further achieve a harmonious outcome. Specifically, we employ approximate dynamic programming and a transfer contract coordination mechanism to address the problem.

Despite thorough testing of the different parts of an SoS, the full behavior often emerges during operation only. The systems and their interactions thus need to be continuously monitored and checked during operation to determine compliance with their requirements. In particular, after changes to one system, it is necessary to check whether the overall SoS still behaves correctly and as intended. Based on an existing monitoring framework we are developing support for capturing and comparing event traces in SoS. Our approach facilitates, and partly automates, identifying differences in event traces, which often indicate undesirable behavior introduced during evolution.

This paper introduces a conceptual model and a scheduling algorithm for supporting real-time requirements in SoS. Real-time support is essential in many safety-relevant application areas such medical, military and industrial SoS. The search for a feasible schedule is computed incrementally upon the introduction of new applications in the SoS. The distributed computation of the schedule using the different constituent systems considers the lack of global knowledge and control in the SoS, while also reducing the overall scheduling time. Concurrent scheduling activities are supported to deal with the uncoordinated and possibly simultaneous introduction of multiple applications. The paper introduces a high-level scheduling algorithm for the SoS as well as a low-level scheduling problem for individual constituent systems. The incremental scheduling problem for the constituent systems is formulated using IBM CPLEX.

The performance levels of the capabilities provided by a system can be improved through additional funds contracted by the SoS architect. The system decides on how to use the allocated funds.

For the next generation of cooperative cyber-physical system-of-systems, safety and security constitute two key issues of public concern that affect the deployment and acceptance. In engineering, the openness and evolutionary nature also entail radical paradigm shifts. This paper presents one novel approach to the development of qualified cyber-physical system-of-systems, with Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) as one target. The approach, referred to as knowledge-in-the-loop, aims to allow a synergy of well-managed lifecycles, formal quality assurance, and smart system features. One research goal is to enable an evolutionary development with continuous and traceable flows of system rationale from design-time to post-deployment time and back, supporting automated knowledge inference and enrichment. Another research goal is to develop a formal approach to risk-aware dynamic treatment of safety and security as a whole in the context of system-of-systems.

2013,Development Interdependency Modeling for System-of-Systems (SoS) using Bayesian Networks: SoS Management Strategy Planning,"Managing the development and evolution of a system-of-systems (SoS) capability remains a challenge due to, among other reasons, the complex interdependencies between participating systems. One form of complexity stems from the tendency of interdependencies to propagate between systems; disruptions in the development of one system may propagate to other dependent systems in successive cycles, creating schedule and cost overruns. Event tree methods and Bayesian Networks (BNs) are used in this paper to quantify development interdependencies between systems and assess cascading development risks. In addition the approach also allows inputs (e.g. development failure rates of participating systems) to be updated automatically for better decision-making. A primary output of the approach is the quantification of development interdependencies and the identification of critical systems with respect to propagating effect levels. This method when applied to a synthetic problem, as a proof-of- concept, demonstrates the robustness of the proposed approach in tackling risk interaction that arises from the cascading effects of development disruptions and clearly illustrates that the propagating effects depend not only on SoS architecture, but on development failure rates of participating systems as well. The outcomes of the analysis provide a support for decision makers to manage risk in development of a SoS with complex interdependencies.",10.1016/j.procs.2013.01.073,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050913000744,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2015,Emergent properties and requirements evolution in engineering systems and a roadmap,"Emergence and emergent properties have been a popular subject in systems of systems design. This work is an extension of Hinton's work on ""under-specification"". Even though emergence is a universal phenomenon that can hardly be modeled, there are still attempts to understand, propose solution what is known by non-desired emergent properties in industrial systems design. This paper focuses also on under specification and impact of requirement evolution. Some approaches even appear to be infeasible as in natural systems; however industrial systems are designed following various methods and techniques and the interface to user is often poorly specified and developed. In that respect, interfaces between systems and human are very hard to model as emergent behavior is hardly predicted and hence largely unknown. The paper attempts at characterising such properties and initiate the debate on a roadmap for such research to support case studies and applications.",10.1109/ICoCS.2015.7483236,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2015,Towards Smart Systems of Systems,"Systems of Systems (SoS) have started to emerge as a consequence of the general trend toward the integration of beforehand isolated systems. To unleash the full potential, the contained systems must be able to operate as elements in open, dynamic, and deviating SoS architectures and to adapt to open and dynamic contexts while being developed, operated, evolved, and governed independently. We name the resulting advanced SoS to be smart as they must be self-adaptive at the level of the individual systems and self-organizing at the SoS level to cope with the emergent behavior at that level. In this paper we analyze the open challenges for the envisioned smart SoS. In addition, we discuss our ideas for tackling this vision with our SMARTSOS approach that employs open and adaptive collaborations and models at runtime. In particular, we focus on preliminary ideas for the construction and assurance of smart SoS.",10.1007/978-3-319-24644-4_1,,springerlink
2015,On the Architecture-Driven Development of Software-Intensive Systems-of-Systems,"Nowadays, complex software-intensive systems have resulted from the integration of heterogeneous independent systems, thus leading to a new class of systems called Systems-of-Systems (SoS). As in any system, SoS architectures have been regarded as an important element for determining their success. However, the state of the art reveals shortcomings that contribute to compromise the quality of these systems, as their inherent characteristics (such as emergent behavior and evolutionary development) are often not properly addressed. In this context, this PhD research aims at investigating how SoS software architectures can be used to model and evolve these systems. As main contribution, an architecture-centric approach for developing software-intensive SoS with focus on the formal specification and dynamic reconfiguration of their architectures is proposed. Such an approach mainly intends to contribute to fill some of the relevant existing gaps regarding the development of software-intensive SoS driven by their software architectures.",10.1109/ICSE.2015.287,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2015,An Agent-Oriented Perspective on System of Systems for Multiple Domains,"Modeling and Simulation (M&S) plays a central role as a primary tool for representing a system of systems (SoS) and for the study of its evolution, behaviors, and performances. However, with respect to large-scale systems, SoSs present different and peculiar aspects that need to be accurately taken into account and are essential to address for the definition of effective approaches for M&S of SoSs. This chapter proposes a new perspective on SoS M&S based on the adoption of the agent-based paradigm. Specifically, after the identification of the main issues for the M&S of SoSs, some of the main approaches for the M&S of SoSs are evaluated and compared in the chapter. Then, an agent-oriented perspective for SoS M&S, able to fully address the identified issues and overcoming the limitations of the currently available solutions, is proposed and exemplified by application examples in multiple domains. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",10.1002/9781118501757.ch8,,scopus; wiley
2015,Replacing capabilities within a system-of-systems: An architectural study on how to simplify the national airspace system,"The National Airspace System (NAS) is an enterprise system-of-systems designed to provide safe and efficient air travel in the United States. While the system is effective at accomplishing these tasks, the initial design for the NAS predated much of the formal systems engineering processes known today. This produced a complex system architecture that is not well suited to meet the needs of future system use and impedes implementing new requirements into the current system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently working on evolving the NAS into the Next Generation Air Traffic Control System (NextGen). With NextGen the FAA is applying classical systems engineering practices and can start to apply new practices from system-of-systems engineering (SoSE). Since SoSE is a growing discipline most of the early research has focused on identifying an unambiguous definition for a system-of-systems and developing new system-of-systems. However, one of the key challenges with NextGen is not to develop a new system-of-systems but instead to improve upon the system performance by redesigning and simplifying the current NAS architecture. This paper expands on current system-of-system development research in order to explore how to simplify an existing system-of-systems architecture by replacing the capabilities of the current system. The NAS in its entirety is too large and too complex of a system to fully analyze in this paper, and so the scope will be limited to the surveillance capability of the NAS. © 2015 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

2015,A System of Systems Framework for Microgrids,"Distributed generation has made its mark in the power distribution system, as a consequence of economic and environmental considerations. With the exponential advancement of technology, unconventional sources of generation, storage, and microturbines have been enhanced. The microgrid has paved its way into distributed generation and looks promising for future prospects. On the other hand, to better cope with the challenges posed by the world today, the transition of systems engineering principles to complex, large-scale, integrated, and evolutionary system of systems (SoS) has occurred. This chapter aims at coupling the concept of microgrid with that of SoS. A framework is proposed for the microgrids, considering its remarkable resemblance to SoS characteristics. The reason for microgrids to be regarded as SoS is discussed and the architecture of microgrids is designed from a SoS point of view. The operation of the microgrid under the proposed framework is presented and the benefits of the framework are expressed.

We seek a science and approach that we believe will provide richer insight into SoS failure, “health” maintenance, repair, replication, growth, and mutation-all those features of the evolution of systems which constantly challenge us and which, thus far, we have only been able to explain via macrolevel models and tools. We propose to go deeper into the structure of these systems and to discover their “DNA” (building blocks), thus establishing a foundation to understand their behavior using biological analogies, which we believe will turn out to be more than metaphors.

By exploiting the peculiar characteristics of flexibility and expandability of the CSK system, CSG will integrate innovative technological elements that will make possible new and more advanced civil and military applications [1]. The high Earth observation capability provided by CSG will fully meet the future needs of the entire country and will be shared by the Italian Defence with the European defense community in the frame of the ""System of Systems"" European agreements. The design of the new generation system is conducted on the basis of the experience of the first generation and is therefore upgraded and evolved in both architectural/operational design and logics of satellite and instrument management. The lesson learned and the new demanding needs of CSG mission in terms of image quality performances led also to the evolution of CSK Calibration and Validation functions and capabilities (CALVAL). The new SAR operative modes and performances, have driven the development of new image quality processors as well as the evolution of the existing algorithms. Accurate models of new passive calibrators have been developed with the aim to improve radiometric and geometric accuracies. The handling of higher data volume (e.g. dual polarization) and the generation of calibration tables to comply with new demanding requirements (e.g. geolocation) have been also challenging drivers of the new CALVAL design that will be in charge of all the verification, validation and certification activities.

2014,Systems of systems: The Innovation phase - How are they born?,"In the last ten years there is an increased interest in System of Systems (SoS). The availability and affordability of communication made many systems to connect to each other and create networks with different stakeholders who collaborate to achieve common goals. There are many examples of SoS around us and they are part of our everyday life such as: Net Centric Warfare (NCW) System, transportation, electric grid, hotel chains, navigation, banking etc ... are all Systems of Systems. Communication, computers and miniaturization are the key enablers which are driving the evolution of systems into SoS. Those technologies are accelerating the high connectivity between many types of systems, data bases, processes and stakeholders. The medium and large systems integrators industries have a growing interest in SoS. As they are always trying to move upwards the value chain in order to maintain their survivability and growth. Since systems are part of SoS even small companies must understand the new environment of SoS. To maintain growth companies must seek for introducing new systems, capabilities or processes to the market. Today this innovation phase is done in the environment of SoS. Shumpeter claims that companies and even societies must innovate and introduce new systems in order to survive. This leads to the following most critical questions: How a System of Systems is born? What are the innovation processes the industry has to exercise in order to develop a new SoS? Are those processes similar to system's innovation? Or there are differences? - Those are important issues to be addressed by the academy and also by the industry in order to maintain their growth in a new world of complex SoS. Despite its importance and criticality there is not much in the literature about the innovation phase of SoS. In this paper we will discuss how Systems of Systems are born and in what aspect they are differ from Systems from the innovation point of view.

Before starting to define reference architectures for process-oriented SOA in SoS it would be advantageous to learn more about the current state of process handling in a SoS. The objective of the current paper is to describe the different approaches to implementing processes in a SoS. The term processing chain is introduced as an abstract representation of processes in SoS.

Systems in this context are independently designed and can operate autonomously following both global SoS goals and individual goals. A major aspect of SoSs is the evolution over time, i.e. the change of its architecture as a result of changes in the context of the SoS or the changes of individual or global goals. The aim of this paper is to define a modeling concept for evolution specifying all possible changes of the SoS over time. This evolution model is used to generate and analyze future architectures enabling the prediction of future violations of static specifications. We derive so called dynamicity contracts and restrict the evolution model in such a manner, that false architectures are not reached.",,,scopus

In recent years, this kind of adaptive systems has been carefully studied; however, they often operate at a very different scale, being smaller than a typical SoS. The common nexus between both perspectives seem to be situated at the architectural level: the same adaptive techniques are recursively applied in different strata in a hierarchical composite. Therefore, the principles embodied in adaptive architectures seem to provide a good basis for the definition and description of SoS. This paper relates those principles to the corresponding structures in software evolution, and suggests to coordinate both through a pace layering strategy.",10.1145/2489850.2489856,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2489850.2489856,acm; scopus; googlescholar

This paper describes strategies for value sustainment, using an application of the “wave model” to represent time-varying SoS Engineering (SoSE) activities and opportunities for SoS-change. A Maritime Security (MarSec) SoS case study is described, and simulation-based Era Analysis is used to evaluate SoS alternatives through different operational environments for an assumed 8-year time frame. Eight SoS designs are evaluated and compared across four strategies in terms of accumulated utility, discounted cost, and total down time. The four value sustainment strategies are: (1) self-recovery, the SoS is not changed (i.e., relating to survivability/robustness); (2) changes in the design of the SoS are allowed (i.e., relating to changeability); (3) changes in the architecture of the SoS are allowed (i.e., relating to evolvability) once, or (4) three times in the eight years. The results provide an example of how quantitative approaches can be used to gain insights into tradeoffs in how SoS architects can create value-sustainable SoSs for the long run.",10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549963,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6549963/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2009,Exploring the synergy between Industrial Ecology and System of Systems to understand complexity: a case study in air transportation,"Two objectives are pursued in this article. First, from a methodological perspective, we explore the relationships among the constructs of complex adaptive systems, systems of systems, and industrial ecology. Through examination of central traits of each, we find that industrial ecology and system of systems present complementary frameworks for posing systemic problems in the context of sociotechnical applications. Furthermore, we contend that complexity science (the basis for the study of complex adaptive systems) provides a natural and necessary foundation and set of tools to analyze mechanisms such as evolution, emergence, and regulation in these applications. The second objective of the article is to illustrate the use of two tools from complexity sciences to address a network transition problem in air transportation framed from the system-of-systems viewpoint and shaped by an industrial ecology perspective. A stochastic simulation consisting of network theory analysis combined with agent-based modeling to study the evolution of an air transport network is presented. Patterns in agent behavior that lead to preferred outcomes across two scenarios are observed, and the implications of these results for decision makers are described. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity for future efforts to combine the merits of both system of systems and industrial ecology in tackling the issues of complexity in such large-scale, sociotechnical problems.",10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,googlescholar

2013,An Approach to Facilitate Decision Making on Architecture Evolution Strategies,"The evolution of System of Systems (SoS) architectures is a difficult process due to the complex interactions between entities that exist in an SoS. Adequate tools are thus needed in capturing these interdependencies to support informed decisions on architectural evolutions. In this paper, an approach is introduced to facilitate decision making on architecture evolution strategies. The main purpose of evolving architecture is to satisfy advanced capability and performance objectives through adding new systems, replacing existing systems, changing links, etc. The paper employs Colored Petri Nets (CPN), a powerful discrete event dynamic simulation tool, to model, simulate and evaluate the existing and evolving architectures. However, it is unrealistic to improve performance without considering the cost of architecture evolutions. This paper regards complexity as an indicator of the architecture evolving cost. Compared to other complexity metrics, dynamic complexity is included in the complexity metric in this paper. Eventually, an appropriate evolution choice could be achieved by examining the tradeoff space between complexity and performance. This approach is illustrated with a conceptual SoS problem.",10.1016/j.procs.2013.01.029,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience

Through a case study this paper shows how the technique can identify the vulnerabilities that may arise within a given System of System configuration; and explore the resilience of a given system when considering evolution and unexpected circumstances.",10.1109/ICECCS.2010.40,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5628610/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2013,Emergence and Complexity of Systems of Systems,"Summary This chapter demonstrates how a “system of systems” constitutes a concept which is contrasted with the concept of “unitary technological system” within technological systems theory. It places the relevance of the concept of “system of systems” within the scope of the formation, the ontogenesis of this category of technological systems under an alliance's initiative. The chapter shows which type of concrete referents this concept denotes. The chapter discusses the way concrete systems, and in particular technological systems, develop, evolve, and finally become obsolete. Like unitary systems, systems of systems belong in the definition of technological systems. However, systems of systems have several distinguishing characteristics, which are explained in the chapter.

2012,Extending VDM-RT to enable the formal modelling of System of Systems,"When one wish to properly engineer dynamically evolving System of Systems (SoS) it is important to have tools that enable the different stakeholders to understand the consequences of diverse design decisions. Instead of merely using natural text and/or graphical diagrams we propose to make use of slight improvements to existing technology from the formal methods area to enable simulation of a model of the SoS. Here, we present how an extension of the tool support for the VDM Real Time (VDM-RT) technology enabling dynamic reconfiguration can form the basis for properly validating evolving SoS.",10.1109/SYSoSE.2012.6384156,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6384156/,ieeeexplore; scopus; googlescholar

2012,Assessing the impact of development disruptions and dependencies in analysis of alternatives of system-of-systems,"The development of a System-of-Systems SoS remains a highly challenging endeavor due to the complex interdependencies between systems that often times exhibit managerial and operational independence, yet, must work cohesively to achieve an overarching set of capabilities. Current guidelines set forth by the Department of Defense SoS System Engineering guide presents SoS SE as a set of seven core elements which are connected to the 16 technical and management processes in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook DAG. This guide, however, and subsequent frameworks such as the Wave Model, are meant to raise awareness of the key issues and products involved. A need exists to create and mature decision support tools to support the decision making process of evolving SoS architectures this includes the need for properly assessing the impact that potential disruptions can have, and the analysis of alternatives of SoS constructs. Trades between capability and risk are essential decisions that must be addressed for SoS capability planning. Existing tools for such trades, where they exist, can be ineffective and non-intuitive when size andor interdependency complexity is high. These features create a tradeoff space between development risk and capability potential of a system. The objective of RT-36 was to explore analytical methods to quantify the impact of system interdependencies in the context of SoS capability development and use this to guide system engineering activity for SoS. A variety of approaches are investigated to provide a means to conduct analysis of alternatives while navigating the decision space that simultaneously considers the potential positive impacts of interdependencies e.g., SoS capability as well as the negative impacts e.g. consequences of disruption in development. The research in RT-36 centered on seven analytical methods that have been adapted to support SoS architecting decisions and systems engineering of constituent systems.",,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA582893,googlescholar
2012,Why optimisation of a system of systems is both unattainable and unnecessary,"The operational and managerial independence, geographic distribution, emergent behaviour, and evolutionary development that characterise a system of systems (SoS) also ensure that it is impossible to truly optimise it. However, using the concept of satisficing, we can declare that a 'good enough' solution is in fact, sufficient. Why are we all right with this potentially unsettling notion in the context of a system of systems? In part, due to the principle of finite causality introduced in this paper, stating no system outcome can have infinitely bad (or good) implications; thus, the outcome of any action or series of actions is finite in nature. This realisation further bolsters the acceptability of an inherently sub-optimal SoS. This paper explores the notions of why optimisation of a SoS is both: 1) unattainable based on its inherent characteristics and associated systems principles; and 2) unnecessary in practice.

An approach is suggested utilizing computational intelligence, agent based modeling, and wireless ad hoc network simulation as a computational testbed for exploring the generalized dynamics of complex adaptive systems. Utilizing a standard 802.11 ad hoc protocol set, the network can be understood in terms of its capabilities and limitations. Agent based modeling facilitates the individual autonomy aspect of system of systems participants and is responsible for determining how a node will use the 802.11 protocol. Evolutionary algorithms can be used to evolve the protocol usage strategies of the individuals. It is proposed that the evolutionary algorithm and agent based model provide the flexibility and autonomy needed to simulate a representative system of systems while the clear definition of the 802.11 protocol provides a framework for the experiment.",10.1016/j.procs.2011.08.009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050911004741,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2010,A system of systems approach to disaster management,"Disaster situation management involves managing information and resources to tackle time varying situations surrounding a geo-spatial region of interest. Post disaster, relief and recovery operations are handled in a distributed self-configuring manner and involve a diverse array of resources and participants. Although in-situ planning is the only option, disaster situation management should consider system requirements, processes and interdependencies to make the process effective. Having a higher level view of the system, its requirements and the evolving situations warrant the need for accurate models; models that are able to predict, forecast and deal with the logistical, technical, operational, and financial challenges. We propose a system of systems approach to situation modeling to represent the causal relationships between resources, functional assets and different stages in the infrastructure renewal process. Generic interactions at the situation and system level have been defined and theory is developed for the use of fuzzy graphical models. A genetic algorithms based technique has been developed to determine optimal structure and parameters of the graphical model. Real world data from a post earthquake reconstruction process is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",10.1109/MCOM.2010.5434385,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5434385/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

They are characterised [2] as being composed of many heterogeneous systems that are geographically distributed; independently managed and/or operated; evolve over time; and exhibit emergent behaviour. There is a need to better understand the enterprise nature of the domains (e.g. defence, utilities, and transport) to enable human participants in such systems to cope more effectively with the increase in complexity that SoS imply. Current methods and approaches in Human Factors (HF) are inadequate in addressing SoS aspects associated with technical and organisational complexity.

2012,Design method requirements for agile system of systems,"The paper defines the need for new and innovative methods for business analysts to analyze and design systems in the emerging agile environments. The paper goal is to provide models for business analysts to identify collaborative arrangements needed to sustain collaboration within continually evolving business environment. The paper begins by describing the characteristics of the emerging environments and the requirements of new design methodologies. It focuses on ways to manage complexity, process integration and emphasis on social structures needed to respond creatively to changes in the environment. The goal is to create an architecture that encourages the emergence of new collaborations in response to changes in the environment and can easily accommodate process change. The collaborative architecture defines the collaborative arrangements and responsibilities to make the collaboration sustainable. The paper develops a framework to describe business networks as a system of systems and ways to model collaboration between the different systems. The paper then proposes living systems theory as the framework for identifying the relationships of business units of different organizations and the messaging structure to support emerging collaboration between the business units. The paper illustrates a way to model a system of systems using living systems theory. It combines this theory with open modelling to show ways to manage complexity, process integration and collaboration. It then describes the kinds of tools needed to support the modelling and illustrates with an example of its use. It uses process outsourcing that involves a number of partners and suppliers as an example. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.",,,scopus; webofscience

This will enable analysts to appropriately model and understand the SoS evolving behaviour due to the continued forced changes imposed on them. To place this need in historical perspective, the evolution of the field of systems engineering/analysis is briefly reviewed. The complexity of SoS is characterised by the highly interconnected and interdependent physical and economic infrastructure sectors of every country in the world, which introduce significant modelling challenges for the systems analysts. Economic, physical, cyber, workforce, organisational, and international intra- and interdependencies are introduced. Particular economic interdependency models (the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) and its derivatives) follow. Hierarchical Holographic Modelling (HHM) for studying the multiple dimensions of risk to SoS is introduced, followed by the Phantom System Models (PSM) for modelling emergent large-scale SoS.

2020,Adding a detrital actor to increase system of system resilience: A case study test of a biologically inspired design heuristic to guide sociotechnical network evolution,"Networking complex sociotechnical systems into larger Systems of Systems (SoS) typically results in improved performance characteristics including sustainability, efficiency, and productivity. The response, or lack thereof, of many SoS to unexpected constituent system failures undermines their effectiveness in many cases. SoS performance after faults can be improved by improving the SoS’s hard (physical design) or soft (human intervention) resilience. The current approaches to increase resilience are limited due to the cost and necessary of human response increasing non-linearly with SoS scale. The limitations of current approaches require a novel design approach to improve SoS network resilience. We hypothesize that biologically inspired network design can improve SoS resilience. To illustrate this, a systems dynamics model of a Forestry Industry is presented and an optimization search over potential hard and soft resilience approaches is compared to a biologically inspired network improvement. SoS network resilience is measured through the newly developed System of System Resilience Measurement (SoSRM). Our first result provides evidence that biologically inspired network design provides an approach to increase SoS resilience beyond hard and soft resilience improvements alone. Second, this work provides evidence that having a SoS constituent fulfill the ecosystem role of detrital actor increases resilience. Third, this paper documents the first case study using the new SoSRM metric to justify a design decision. Finally, this case study provides a counter-example to the theory that increased sustainability always results in increased resilience. By comparing biologically inspired network redesign and optimized traditional resilience improvements, this paper provides evidence that biologically inspired intervention may be the needed strategy to increase sociotechnical SoS network resilience, improve SoS performance, and overcome the limitations of traditional resilience improvement approaches.

""Open at the top"" means that there is no pre-defined top level application. New applications may be created at any time. ""Open at the bottom"" means that the system primitives are defined functionally rather than concretely. This allows the implementation of these primitives to be modified as technology changes. ""Continually (but slowly) evolving"" means that the system's functionality is stable enough to be useful but is understood to be subject to modification. Systems with these properties tend to be environments within which other systems operate - and hence are systems of systems.

2011,System of systems engineering with the ESA architecture framework,"This paper presents an overview of the ESA Architecture Framework (ESA-AF) and supporting tools which have been developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). A new activity has been started to consolidate and improve ESA-AF and the supporting tools, based on the initial feedback of the different stakeholders. The work is being performed for ESA by VEGA. System of Systems (SoS) Engineering addresses the development and operations of evolving programmes that comprise a collaboration of diverse sets of system assets. SoS engineering has its roots in the defence domain and is increasingly being applied in other complex domains such as air transportation, healthcare and global communication networks. In comparison to systems engineering of monolithic systems, SoS engineering is often performed under some level of uncertainty regarding the requirements and the constituent systems, and involves considerations at multiple levels and domains. While traditional systems engineering seeks to optimise individual systems, SoS engineering normally seeks to optimise a network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives. SoS engineering enables the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time. In order to master the analysis and assessment of existing systems as well as the optimisation of future systems, new methods and technologies must be introduced in the ESA environment. To support the definition of these systems of systems ESA has performed a number of studies in the area of Architecture Frameworks. One of these activities has resulted in the development of ESA-AF, which is based on existing frameworks, such as the UK's Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework (MODAF). ESA-AF has now been applied in pilot activities on a number of large programmes. These include the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Galileo global navigation systems. All of these programmes consist of large complex systems of systems for which ESA-AF is able to provide support. The pilot activities have provided valuable feedback on the application of ESA-AF and this experience is being fed back into the ESA-AF consolidation activity. In the paper we present the ESA-AF meta-model, its governance model and the tools that have been developed to exploit SoS models. We then introduce some of the areas that users of ESA-AF have identified for improvement and how this is driving the current activity to consolidate ESA-AF to better meet ESA's future requirements.

2020,Characterizing Systems of Systems change and failure via network-based metrics,"A System of System (SoS) is a synthesis of independent systems functioning together towards a common goal. They are characterized by their dynamic nature and evolvability during operation: Addition, removal, and modification of component systems and functions. It is, therefore, important to characterize the tolerance of such systems to changes and failures. Most change propagation and failure analysis methods require some knowledge of failure and change probabilities, failure modes, and design parameters, which is difficult to obtain or unavailable to an SoS decision-maker, as component systems are independent in their management and operation. Consequently, this paper uses highlevel SoS functional models and network-based metrics to characterize SoSs functions and assess the functional change and failure of such systems. The proposed measures are deployed on an electric vehicle to grid-related service to show how it can aid an SoS decision-maker during the system's development and operation.

Because they can be more easily expressed as an information flow, they are built following the data-flow paradigm. These systems present high availability requirements that make their runtime evolution necessary. This means that integration and system testing will have to be performed at runtime as well. Already existing techniques for runtime integration and testing are usually focused on component-based systems which follow the client-server paradigm, and are not well suited for data-flow systems. In this paper we present virtual components, a way of defining units of data-flow behaviour that greatly simplifies the definition and maintenance of integration tests when the system evolves at runtime. We present and discuss an example of how to use virtual components for thispurpose.",10.1145/1596495.1596499,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1596495.1596499,acm; scopus; googlescholar; webofscience
2010,Constructing program management framework: A system of systems approach,"Programs are aimed at achieving long term objectives that create value to stakeholders. They consist of a portfolio of projects, each of which aims at achieving specific sub-goals. A program emerges as a system of systems (SoS) when these projects are connected in a systemic way to accomplish program objectives. This entails that programs have an architecture that defines how the various projects interact to accomplish the overall objectives. Current program management approaches, however, largely treat programs as a collection of projects that are managed operationally to optimize outcomes at each level, rather than as a system to be architected. This paper develops a systemic architecture for programs in terms of three interconnected facets: value realization, program construction and program execution, and highlights the role of program worldview in this. Each of these facets brings out some aspects of the way in which projects relate to each other within a program. We propose an iterative framework in which models are developed for addressing each facet, but there is also an overall structure of activity and information flows that facilitates interplay and co-evolution of the models. The result is a holistic approach to managing programs as a system of systems, at a level over and above project management. ©2010 IEEE.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482471,,scopus

Current component integration and verification techniques are not enough in such a dynamic environment. In this paper we present ATLAS, an architectural framework that enables the runtime integration and verification of a system, based on the built-in test paradigm. ATLAS augments components with two specific interfaces to add and remove tests, and to provide adequate testability features to run these tests. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study of a dynamic reconfiguration scenario of components, in the maritime safety and security domain, using our implementation of ATLAS for the fractal component model. We demonstrate that built-in testing can be extended beyond development-time component integration testing, to support runtime reconfiguration and verification of component-based systems.",10.1109/ASEW.2008.4686292,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4686292/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

System of systems (SoS) in an environment dominated by applying NetCentric principles and influenced by our customers would, by its very nature, require us to redefine how we apply system engineering. This paper presents observations on what would influence and define the evolution of system engineering into the SoS environment. It highlights new competencies that would be needed in order to leverage SoS.

The capability to predict future values and outcomes allow optimal decisions and process adjustments to mitigate risk and achieve objectives. This is an application paper that explores improving the accuracy and precision of generating predicted values and decisions with time-series data by integrating existing data mining technologies and information systems. Existing systems are integrated into a System-of-System (SoS) meta-architecture utilizing the Flexible and Intelligent Learning Architecture for SoS (FILA-SoS) [2].

Architectures are generated, assessed, and selected using evolutionary algorithms integrated with a Fuzzy Inference System.

2008,Testing Challenges of Maritime Safety and Security Systems-of-Systems,"Maritime Safety and Security systems represent a novel kind of large-scale distributed component-based systems in which the individual components are elaborate and complex systems in their own right. Two distinguishing characteristics are their ability to evolve during runtime, that is, joining and leaving of components, and the need for high reliability of the system. In this paper, we identify the challenges that will have to be addressed, given the current state of the art in component-based software engineering in order to build such system-of-systems. In particular, we highlight the specific difficulties regarding acceptance and testing. A first group of testing challenges is raised by the need of accepting the integration of such large systems, and the ability to reconfigure them at runtime. A second group of testing challenges comes from the fact that, generally, not all the sub-systems are designed along the same kind of architecture (e.g. client-server vs. publish-subscribe architecture).

2001,System of Systems (SoS) enterprise systems engineering for information-intensive organizations,"Abstract This article describes the emerging roles of the systems engineering (SE) function in supporting enterprise management in information-intensive organizations. “Enterprise Systems Engineering” (ESE) comprises three major roles or “levels” of systems engineering for successful and efficient development or procurement of large complex systems of systems (SoS). While the authors' experience focuses predominantly on government organizations acting as their own SoS integrators, the SoS ESE concept has generic applicability for any organization, public or private, seeking to attain competitive advantage through leveraging of information technology resources and systems. The processes and tools described here have been developed and successfully employed to facilitate government project management and investment decisions and control. [Carlock and Decker, 1998] This paper describes a formal three-level SoS ESE process that, at the top level, organizes and maintains all of the details of the enterprise-wide SoS architecture and strategic development plan in a flexible framework that accommodates the changes expected over a long SoS evolution. The information maintained in this framework allows the organization to know where it is going, how and when it is going to get there, the required capabilities and interfaces of each SoS component, and the impact of changes to system requirements, budgets, schedules, etc., on the overall SoS. The middle level processes allow the organization to perform trade studies among alternative solutions to implement required capabilities based on what is best for the enterprise-wide SoS rather than just local considerations. The end result of the middle level processes is a selected and approved solution and its associated cost, schedule, benefits, and technical baselines. The third level processes implement the approved solutions in accordance with the approved baselines. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Syst Eng 4: 242–261, 2001",10.1002/sys.1021,,wiley

The Ballistic Missile Defense System is an integrated, 'layered"" architecture of ground- and seabased interceptor missiles that provides multiple opportunities to destroy missiles and their warheads before they can reach their targets. The independent OA provides an annual snapshot of the system capabilities and limitations based on the testing that has been conducted throughout the year. Due to the inherent limitations of real-world data, modeling and simulation (M&S) is a necessary component to provide comprehensive OAs. The overarching challenge is the accreditation of M&S representing element, component, and overall system capabilities across a multinational/multi-service system of systems in a spiral development process of technology insertions and fielding. The BMDS OTA Team has designed a proven approach and process in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) related instructions and guidance to determine the credibility of the results from designated M&S. This document focuses on the BMDS OTA VV&A approach that includes analysis and derivation of acceptance criteria leading to an accreditation of element, component, and system M&S.

2009,3.5.0 Can We Engineer the Emergent Behavior of A System-of-Systems?,"Abstract Emergent behaviors exist in biological systems, physical systems and human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). SoS displays a global complexity that cannot be adequately managed by hierarchical structures and central control; therefore, traditional systems engineering and management approaches are necessary but insufficient for a SoS. Little is currently known about constructing an interoperable network of systems and the incorporation of emergent behaviors. The purpose of this panel is to explore the possibilities of developing an architecture model including the emergent behavior. The challenge is how to understand the initiation mechanisms of the emergent behaviors for a particular system architecture model so that the resident beneficial or harmful emergent behaviors can be enhanced or mitigated with selected changes in the model. Is model-based the only feasible approach to develop the architecture model with emergent behavior? If this is the answer, what kind of modeling methodology? Should it be solely based on agent-based modeling or a combination of SysML and agent-based? Is SysML ready to deal with emergent behavior? For a non-modeling consideration, can we plan for the beneficial or harmful emergent properties? How do we overcome development friction that is bound to arise when there are complex, independent, overlapping governances, for example, the customer requirements for a SoS evolve over time, etc.?

This paper will identify aviation strategic outlook areas that will affect the evolution and implementation of Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management systems that will enable the Future NAS vision. Strategic Outlook Areas examined in this paper are: Resiliency of the NAS, management of NAS Infrastructure and Technology Management planning, reducing the environmental footprint of aviation, minimizing the impact of weather on operations, understanding the Internet-of-Things on aviation, and New Aviation Entrants. In each area, the paper will explore the background, challenges they poses to achieving the future NAS, and key questions that need to be answered to leverage an opportunity or mitigate a risk. The goal of the Aviation Strategic Outlook effort serves as an instrument to inform decision-makers on potential policy, capabilities, procedures, and technology decisions to maintain an appropriate path to the desired or target future. The expected results will set the stage to define an impact statement, identify risks and opportunities to implementation, and proposed strategies to inform decision-makers on a pathway to achieve the future NAS vision.",10.1109/ICNSURV.2018.8384858,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2008,Risk in system of systems engineering and management,"Systems engineering concepts are directly applicable to the development and integration of management and technological processes that support all of the major lifecycle functions needed to produce high quality and trustworthy systems in a total quality fashion. Information is the glue that holds together such processes as: research and development, test and evaluation (RDT&E); system acquisition; and planning and marketing. Systems management deals with such issues as program and project management, technical direction of development, and quality and configuration management of the evolving system such as to achieve risk management. Risk issues abound in many contemporary systems management situations. Often, these situations emerge from behavior of many independent agents who attempt to achieve both individual organizational objectives and objectives of the larger organizational unit seeking to attain an interoperable system of systems or system family from the efforts of the individual organizations. A complex system of systems will often exhibit evolutionary, emergent, and adaptive behavior when the individual systems are architected, engineered and integrated to achieve the composite system of systems. Of course, evolutionary, emergent, and adaptive behavior may well exist even when systems are not consciously architected, engineered, and integrated. But this behavior may well be not at all desired. Complex adaptive system behavior manifests itself at the level of both the individual system and the composite system family. These changes are generally experienced as emergent or evolutionary processes. It is for this reason that emergence has been defined as system behavior that evolves from interaction of many participants, and cannot be predicted or even envisioned from knowledge of the isolated behavior of each system or each individual design team. Modeling and simulation are essential in the engineering of large systems of all types, especially those that are subject to evolutionary and path dependent results. Whether we are dealing with human-made systems, human systems, or organizational systems; there is a need to organize and manage for complexity, and associated knowledge and enterprise integration, ultimately for the betterment of all concerned. In this paper, we examine these risk management issues for a system of systems, especially one operating in a federated environment.",10.3934/jimo.2008.4.477,,scopus; webofscience

In a well-known paper, Maier postulated five principal characteristics that distinguish today’s sociotechnical systems composed of existing complex systems. Those systems are called SoSs and their constituents are called CSs. SoSs are characterized by five properties: operational independence of the components, managerial independence of the components, evolutionary development, geographic distribution, and emergent behavior where the latter is explained as: “The system performs functions and carries out purposes that do not reside in any component system. These behaviors are emergent properties of the entire SoS and cannot be localized to any component system. The purposes of the SoS are fulfilled by these behaviors”.",10.1016/B978-1-78548-256-4.50001-6,,sciencedirect; scopus

2008,Capability Test Methodology's role in system of systems life cycle acquisition,"The Joint Test and Evaluation Methodology (JTEM) joint test & evaluation (JT&E) program is currently developing an enterprise-level Capability Test Methodology (CTM) to deliver high quality joint capability test and evaluation (T&E) across the acquisition life cycle. This Department of Defense (DOD) enterprise initiative is addressing the problem that processes for system of systems (SoS) tests in the joint mission environment (JME) are not well defined or integrated across defense acquisition system phases. Current DOD acquisition policy has a basis in the systems engineering ""Vee"" process model, which portrays phased verification testing at component, subsystem, and full system operational levels. This is reflected in the current Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) structure, which has separate sections and phasing for developmental and operational T&E. In order to help address this problem, we propose a Capability ""Star"" model, based on JTEM's evolving Capability Evaluation Metamodel (CEM) to enhance the ""Vee"" model. The Star model incorporates capability, SoS, analytical baseline, capability gap, and evaluation measure concepts to provide better consistency in assessing SoS contributions to joint mission effectiveness (JMe) needs of the warfighter. To provide better integration between T&E phases, the Star model introduces the concept of critical joint issues (CJIs), which link assessments of SoS attributes, operational task performance, and mission desired effects. CJIs provide enhanced systems engineering verification traceability through SoS life cycle development. Star model processess include upfront development of an integrated acquisition evaluation strategy, cyclical CJI assessments through various test events, and synthesis of performance results supporting joint missions. The Capability Star model and underlying CEM structure provide a systems engineering assessment methodology which can enhance capabilities-driven acquisition practice, currently based on Vee, spiral, and evolutionary approaches.",,,scopus
2015,Catalysts of Cooperation in System of Systems: The Role of Diversity and Network Structure,"Cooperation and competition are critical aspects of complex systems that intrigue researchers and practitioners alike. Recently, there has been great interest in how structure affects these cooperative behaviors and how they evolve. In this paper, we utilize the methods of evolutionary game theory on graphs to develop a model of the structured evolution of adaptive agents. Rather than simple memoryless agents, we employ adaptive agents that take on a diverse set of strategies including the cooperative catalyst tit-for-tat (TFT) and its generous and suspicious variants. We also employ all-defect, unconditional cooperation, and random strategies. Agents use these strategies during their evolution in order to maximize their own relative fitness, measured by their performance in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game versus their structural neighbors. We test the model with a variety of regular graph structures with variable degree, randomness, and size. Our parallel-execution agent-based simulations show that each strategy evolves toward its own structural niche with suspicious TFT maintaining the highest survival rate over all structures. We also show that increases in network density make the TFT strategies even more dominant, and connectivity randomness encourages cooperation in sparse networks.",10.1109/JSYST.2013.2284959,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6658829/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2007,The Changing Role of the Systems Engineer in a System of Systems (SOS) Environment,"In traditional Systems Engineering, the Systems Engineer acts as the overall system creator. Primarily through stakeholder interaction, requirements analysis, and architectural design, the Systems Engineering shapes and influences the system solution through specifications, top-down design, and bottoms-up integration and test. With the large-scale introduction of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, the Systems Engineer acts more like a composer. The top-down requirements and design activities need to be adjusted to account for the bottoms-up constraints imposed by the COTS technology. The System Engineer shapes and influences COTS-based developments through requirements modifications and negotiations, along with simultaneous system design, integration, and test. This paper explores the changing role of the Systems Engineer in today's complex system of systems (SoS) environment. We will use the analogies of conductor and choreographer to describe the System Engineering leadership challenges that exist in a SoS environment. Similar to a conductor, we will look at the set of activities that ensure the elements in the SoS work together in harmony. Similar to a choreographer, we will look at the set of activities that ensure the expressive nature of each of the SoS elements is fully realized, while still conforming to its overall objectives. Using these analogies, we will draw some conclusions for the evolving Systems Engineering role in a SoS environment.

Evidence indicates that transmission failures and performance issues are not uncommon occurrences. In a NASA-supported Software Assurance Research Program (SARP) project, we are researching a new approach to addressing such problems. In this paper, we are presenting an approach for analyzing intersystem communications with the goal to uncover both transmission errors and performance problems. Our approach consists of a visualization and an evaluation component. While the visualization of the observed communication aims to facilitate understanding, the evaluation component automatically checks the conformance of an observed communication (actual) to a desired one (planned). The actual and the planned are represented as sequence diagrams. The evaluation algorithm checks the conformance of the actual to the planned diagram. We have applied our approach to the communication of aerospace systems and were successful in detecting and resolving even subtle and long existing transmission problems.

2007,The transformational potential of modeling and simulation technology when applied across the lifecycle of large scale Systems of Systems (SoS) enterprises,"What is the potential benefit achieved by using M&S throughout the entire lifecycle of a system or System of Systems (SoS)? We consider the case of an ongoing U.S. Army Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA) program, Future Combat Systems (FCS), and how M&S has been used, and is planned to be used, throughout the lifecycle of this System of Systems (SoS). Specifically we focus on the early stages of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, the software / system development lifecycle (SDLC) in use (Win-Win Spiral), with M&S fine-tuning using the Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP), and examine specific probe points at which it is considered beneficial to collect M&S insights. We examine the nature of this interaction during Requirements Development, Design, and Integration and Test. We explore the difficulty of maintaining coordinated interfaces between M&S and the transforming enterprise, and the need to establish probe points that foster the ability of M&S to Pace the evolution of the enterprise. We learn from this examination the need for a higher degree of standards convergence between M&S software and Operational software. We examine the relationship between enterprise transformation and M&S, and the potential for M&S technology to dramatically contribute to the transformational benefits of the enterprise. We further extrapolate from this particular case study and offer some generalizations about the promising trends for application of M&S to other large scale enterprises - especially those with intangible or difficult to quantify parameters, embedded among more easily quantifiable parameters, and those enterprises undergoing transformation. Finally, we propose to examine several additional probe points of the lifecycle of the FCS program in future papers using this same methodology.",,,scopus; scopus
2007,Framework for understanding and shaping systems of systems - The case of industry and infrastructure development in seaport regions,"A framework has been developed that enables actors to understand and shape industry-infrastructure system-of-systems in seaport regions. The framework connects knowledge engineering with the simulation of system-of-systems evolution. It consists of a system decomposition method using ontologies, a modular agent based model and a knowledge feedback process. The framework was developed and used in a study on fostering biobased cluster evolution in the Eemsdelta, the Netherlands. To support regional development authorities who must balance the interest of each company and the system-of-systems network metrics were developed and incorporated in the simulation. Use of the framework creates a socially accepted model for systems-of-systems analysis that can directly be converted into live simulations to visualize possible directions of its evolution, which results can be used to feedback to the knowledge process.",,,webofscience

2014,A Flexible Framework for Runtime Monitoring of System-of-Systems Architectures,"Many software systems today have system-of systems (SoS) architectures comprising interrelated and heterogeneous systems, which are developed by multiple teams and companies. Such systems emerge gradually and it is hard to analyze or predict their behavior due to their scale and complexity. In particular, certain behavior only emerges at runtime due to complex interactions between the involved systems and their environment. Monitoring the behavior of SoS at runtime is thus essential during development and evolution. However, existing monitoring approaches are often limited to particular architectural styles or technologies and are thus hard to apply in SoS architectures. In this paper we first analyze the challenges for monitoring SoS based on an industrial SoS for the automation of metallurgical plants. We then propose a flexible framework for monitoring heterogeneous systems within a SoS. We demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to two systems of an industrial SoS. We also report results of an evaluation assessing the framework's performance and scalability.",10.1109/WICSA.2014.12,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6827101/,ieeeexplore; scopus; googlescholar

2006,Systems of systems engineering in the enterprises context: A unifying framework for dynamics,"Systems of systems engineering (SoSE) takes place in the broader context of an enterprise, which we define very generally as a purposeful or industrious undertaking. Enterprises of greatest interest for SoSE are typically complex, multi-agent organizations or sets of organizations exhibiting the characteristics of Complex Adaptive Systems, including evolutionary and emergent behaviors at multiple scales. The most fundamental of enterprise purposes are manifest in enterprise operations, in which the enterprise interacts with the larger world external to itself, and this aspect of enterprise dynamics is modeled SoSE is but one aspect of an enterprise's activities, and the whole set of enterprise activities is predominantly oriented towards accomplishing and supporting the enterprise's mission in operations.

2006,Evolutionary methodologies for aseismic decision support,"One of the primary objectives of the overall earthquake engineering research program is to contribute toward the development of disaster-resilient communities. As a result, there is a general need to model, understand and ultimately direct the behavior of a wide variety of complex multi-scale systems. For example, within the context of a critical care facility, these not only include the structural and non-structural systems that shape the physical environment, but also the organizational systems that define the social and economic climate. Clearly, the problem does not end at the scale of a single hospital. By expanding our view, we can recognize that local communities and large corporations need to make decisions affecting the performance of a system of critical care facilities. At the regional level, one can argue that public policy and resource allocation should be based upon the behavior of systems of systems. Additionally, at each level, there is uncertainty, ambiguity and risk, along with a temporal dimension that must be considered. Evolutionary methodologies may be ideally suited to study and to provide guidance for many of these tasks. Here we concentrate on two aspects of the overall problem, namely, aseismic design and retrofit decision support and organizational decision support. In addition, we attempt to create a theoretical and computational framework that may have applicability for complex decision-making in general.",,,scopus
2006,Testing the test: Distributed testing in support of system of systems integration,"Over the years, Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has developed a mature but constantly evolving distributed M&S capability in support of systems testing. However, new programs, such as Future Combat Systems (FCS) and its Experiment 1.1, have required RTTC to expand beyond support of systems testing and into support of system of systems testing in distributed environments either locally or distant in nature. System of systems testing requires organizations with different areas of expertise to come together to formulate a common test infrastructure. The Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) was chosen to facilitate data sharing across the test network infrastructure. This paper describes how the use of the TENA Middleware and TENA standards can make a test infrastructure ""plug and play"" compatible with other components while greatly reducing the time needed to integrate test components. In order to assess the ability to perform system of systems testing, RTTC deployed several key components in support of the horizontal integration of the test infrastructure. Range-in-a-Box was used to collect and send data onto the test network infrastructure. The RTTC Camera Control was used to provide live video of any instrumented or tracked experiment participant. The SIMDIS Visualization Tool was used to provide real-time situational awareness of the entire experiment, including sensor data and tactical position information. Finally, the Reflect Suite was used to log all TENA data on the test network and 583 playback test runs as-needed. This TENA-enabled integrated test network infrastructure allowed for full situational awareness and real-time remote instrumentation command and control from any point on the test network, including from over 2,000 miles away. In addition to system of systems testing, RTTC has started to investigate the benefits of being more actively engaged in the Integration Phase of the system acquisition process. This will enable RTTC to help system developers troubleshoot and solve integration issues with their systems at a very early stage before the systems enter evaluation.",,,scopus
2005,Systems of Systems and Coordinated Atomic Actions,"System of systems (SoS) is an emerging field in the design and development of complex systems that are built from large scale component systems. A SoS has the following attributes: operational and managerial independence of components, a geographic extent that limits control mechanisms to information exchange, an evolutionary nature, and emergent behavior. The subsystems that comprise the SoS often are built by different organizations with conflicting goals, designed under different assumptions and built to different quality standards. These factors impact fault detection, fault isolation, and fault tolerance and can result in systems that cannot easily be debugged, integrated, or maintained. When fault detection and fault tolerance are deficient, the system may behave in a fragile or brittle manner, randomly and repeatedly crashing. Crashes prevent automated diagnosis algorithms from being executed and can prevent manual root cause analysis by erasing system state. Fragility during system integration can prevent achieving schedule milestones and deadlines. Deficient fault detection and fault isolation also impacts end users and system maintainers. (Think <insert name="""" of="""" infamous="""" project="""" here="""">).From the system architect's point of view, designing a system that can detect all possible fault conditions across all components can be an extremely difficult, if not impossible challenge. Can any system be trusted to diagnose or repair itself when it has been corrupted by faults? How do you prevent local faults from growing into global failures? The end users may have unreasonable expectations about how the system should behave when components within the SoS behave abnormally or fail. They may expect better behavior than the typical PC. The system maintainers may expect a coherent systems view of failures to isolate faulted components and to provide an orderly and safe shutdown or recovery.(Think power grid blackouts, Telecomm failures, etc.)The most beneficial way to achieve fault tolerance is to design in fault detection and fault reporting such that defined boundaries such as subsystems serve as natural firewalls for fault containment. Although partitioning the system into subsystems for fault containment is well known and practiced, the end result as experienced at the time of system integration is rarely a success. COTS middleware, intended to aid distributed design often becomes in effect a step backwards by providing fertile ground for faults and failures that breach fault containment boundaries. (Think <insert name="""" of="""" os="""" or="""" middleware="""" vendor="""" here="""">)What can be done to improve this situation? This paper addresses the system architectural partitioning concept of the Coordinated Atomic Actions (CAA). CAA promotes a different manner of organizing software architecture that improves fault containment across potentially faulty components. CAA was first invented by members of Brian Randell's research group at the University of Newcastle at Tyne in the mid 1990's. CAA promotes the concept of the ""transaction"" which has been traditionally identified with database applications. When you access your bank account via ATM, you are exercising database transactions within your bank's financial SoS. CAA applies transactions to cooperating concurrent distributed processes, which are the basis for most large complex computing systems.",10.1145/1039174.1039196,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1039174.1039196,acm; googlescholar

2013,Verification and Validation Issues in Systems of Systems,"
Abstract:  The cutting edge in systems development today is in the area of ""systems of
systems"" (SoS) large networks of inter-related systems that are developed and
managed separately, but that also perform collective activities. Such large
systems typically involve constituent systems operating with different life
cycles, often with uncoordinated evolution. The result is an ever-changing SoS
in which adaptation and evolution replace the older engineering paradigm of
""development"". This short paper presents key thoughts about verification and
validation in this environment. Classic verification and validation methods
rely on having (a) a basis of proof, in requirements and in operational
scenarios, and (b) a known system configuration to be proven. However, with
constant SoS evolution, management of both requirements and system
configurations are problematic. Often, it is impossible to maintain a valid set
of requirements for the SoS due to the ongoing changes in the constituent
systems. Frequently, it is even difficult to maintain a vision of the SoS
operational use as users find new ways to adapt the SoS. These features of the
SoS result in significant challenges for system proof. In addition to
discussing the issues, the paper also indicates some of the solutions that are
currently used to prove the SoS.

2023,LEO-PNT for Augmenting Europe's Space-based PNT Capabilities,"With GNSS as flagship, space-based PNT enables the single largest downstream space sector, worth about €150 billion annually and growing at the rate of 10 per cent per year [29]. The associated infrastructures (e.g. Galileo, GPS) are evolving and introducing new capabilities to meet more demanding needs, in a context of hybrid and system-of-systems PNT solutions. Meanwhile, PNT solutions which exploit signals from LEO (what is being called LEO-PNT) are emerging as a major trend of evolution for space-based PNT, backed by the benefits of multi-layer architectures and new industrial and business models in the Space sector (the so-called N ew Space). Many initiatives are now being taken worldwide, driven either by institutional or commercial stakes. Europe is taking part to the evolution of this landscape, supported by solid industrial grounds in New Space capabilities and PNT technologies, as well as by institutional initiatives. For instance, the proposal for a regulation of the European Union to establish IRIS2 (“Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnection & Security by Satellites”) refers to LEO-PNT as potential non-communication mission. In this context, this paper provides an overview of the current initiatives, and in particular, objectives, opportunities, trade-offs and possible solutions for LEO- PNT in the context of evolutions of European space-based infrastructures. The scope comprises an overview of the global LEO-PNT landscape, and in particular of the European one, for both purpose-built LEO- PNT and more opportunistic approaches such as the integration of PNT capabilities in existing or future satcom signals (e.g. 5G NTN). Possible use cases leveraging LEO-PNT are presented together with the associated design drivers and technologies, trade-offs and some examples of working points illustrating the differentiators of LEO-PNT in augmenting and complementing European GNSS capabilities.

2020,Towards a knowledge base to support global change policy goals,"
ABSTRACTIn 2015, it was adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The year after, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) officially came into force. In 2015, GEO (Group on Earth Observation) declared to support the implementation of SDGs. The GEO Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) required a change of paradigm, moving from a data-centric approach to a more knowledge-driven one. To this end, the GEO System-of-Systems (SoS) framework may refer to the well-known Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) paradigm. In the context of an Earth Observation (EO) SoS, a set of main elements are recognized as connecting links for generating knowledge from EO and non-EO data – e.g. social and economic datasets. These elements are: Essential Variables (EVs), Indicators and Indexes, Goals and Targets. Their generation and use requires the development of a SoS KB whose management process has evolved the GEOSS Software Ecosystem into a GEOSS Social Ecosystem. This includes: collect, formalize, publish, access, use, and update knowledge. ConnectinGEO project analysed the knowledge necessary to recognize, formalize, access, and use EVs.

2013,A lean approach to improving SE visibility in large operational systems evolution,"It is often difficult to understand the status of capability development in large operational systems. Schedules are rarely stable. This is due to factors such as: the size and complexity of capabilities; unexpected changes in priorities; depth of supplier chains; variety and availability of special engineering resources; contract structure; and the inherently complex nature of such operations. Lean approaches use the concepts of work in progress (WIP) and capacity to maximize flow through a process. Under certain circumstances, these concepts can be applied to systems engineering and development processes. This paper describes an example implementation of the concept in a large health care system of systems. To enhance both visibility and flow, the approach utilizes visualization techniques, pull-scheduling processes, and a services approach to systems engineering. © 2013 by R. Turner, J. Lane, D.

2022,Validation of Assurance Case for Dynamic Systems,"Aviation safety has accrued and applied decades of understanding on known risks and effective mitigations. That knowledge captured in compliance standards - can be tested for predictable outcomes. Autonomy that involves learning systems tend to be dynamic and may continuously be adapting to their environment. Such continuous adaptation has inherent unknown risks depending upon the guardrails imposed on the learning systems. Design assurance and use of traditional standards are inadequate for these dynamic systems.Assurance Cases are used to present an argument for the assurance of systems. Dynamic systems require that assurance cases be continuously validated. One method of validation is using real time collection of Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) which are crafted during the development of the system. This paper presents the need for SPIs and methods for creating and nurturing the SPIs to help all stakeholders. This method shadows regulations and allows risk-based approvals that may be applied for both conventional and for novel technology.Aviation is facing enormous growth in autonomous technology, reuse of components of unknown pedigree, and new aircraft designs that do not fit into Type classification. Mitigations are more heavily connected to operations, training, and other components of the ecosystem itself. The challenge is to make an assurance case for vehicles within the ecosystem. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by dynamically changing autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions to build safer systems.UL 4600, a Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products applies to fully autonomous road vehicles. The goal-based, technology-neutral features of UL 4600 have been extended to apply to aviation. So applied, the assurance process is adaptable to innovation and discovery while encouraging the current practices of standards compliance and taking a System of Systems (SoS) view. It proposes an assurance case that is an organized argument that a system is acceptable for its intended use with respect to specified concerns (such as safety, security, correctness). This paper gives guidance for validation of an assurance case through monitoring SPI within the operational context. The method by monitoring safety performance indices in the operational environment provides continued validation even as the ecosystem, components and controls change.For approval of novel systems including UAS and AAM, with features that do not lend themselves to traditional compliance methods, regulators have embraced the Safety Continuum perspective, which focuses on safety performance achieving expected outcomes. The performance-based assurance methods can be used with initially wider performance margins for certification of novel products, components of unknown pedigree, and autonomous vehicles. As the performance range is better known the margins can be decreased.Further, this paper recognizes that a one-time initial approval/acceptance is not adequate for learning systems and novel features. The continued validation through performance supports fast-paced development and product evolution. The initial assurance case for a product can limit risk through a closed environment until the margin for some unknowns is validated. for example, if the performance of collision avoidance function using new technology is not known, larger alert limits may be implemented until more confidence is gained after validating the assurance case via SPIs.The approach of monitored SPI throughout the life of the product is now feasible with the aid of big data processing. The aviation industry is already using similar methods for identifying maintenance problems. As systems grow more autonomous, more machine-to-machine exchanges are involved, making it easy to extend the monitoring and prediction practices to SPI.The method also allows for variants and derivatives of the baseline to have their own assurance case within the context of the baseline argument. The key is replacing design approval with through-life assurance that connects continuous operational safety into both the design and airworthiness determinations. The determination is predicated on the monitored SPIs and predicted performance of the product remaining consistent with the assurance argument predictions. This enables even complex automated products to be audited for airworthiness with an evolving ecosystem based on monitored and predictive data.Another advantage of the performance-based assurance case is the public comprehensibility of safety. With SPIs and predictions of performance the automobile segment has paved the way for public scrutiny of automated vehicles. The use of SPIs in aeronautical product assurance will facilitate transparency. This could be accomplished through appropriate dashboards to aid public perception and explain events and precautions taken during the evolution toward more autonomous aviation vehicles. This could reflect a stepwise evolution of complexity.This paper explores how the aviation industry can apply performance-based assurance case methods to assure new and novel as well as systems of unknown pedigree. The same framework could then be extended to autonomous systems and new types of aircraft which do not fit the current Type classification. One of the major benefits of this technology agnostic method are faster risk-based approvals of novel technology within a Safety Continuum.",10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925731,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2022,Upgrading Approach for MaaS Level 4 Using UAF,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is being commercialized and studied worldwide to overcome social issues such as transportation and environmental problems. To implement MaaS, solutions provided by different administrative, operational, and independent enterprises in different industry sectors need to be combined and integrated as a single service according to their objectives and needs. The ultimate goal of MaaS is the integration of social goals (i.e., involving regional policy; also called Level 4). To achieve this, the entirety of the systems constituting MaaS must be viewed as a System of Systems (SoS), and various stakeholders in different industry areas must work closely together based on policy objectives. In this paper, we propose an ""upgrading approach"" to enable the gradual evolution of SoS based on its architecture to achieve MaaS Level 4. The case study is called ""Snow Country MaaS,"" and it considers the heavy snowfall area of Japan. Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) is used for the architecture description. The SoS architecture of Snow Country MaaS is described by an iterative approach based on the strategic, operational, service, and resource perspectives defined in UAF. By applying the upgrading approach to the hierarchical perspectives defined in UAF, it is possible to discuss and determine policies for the evolution and criteria for the entire SoS from multiple perspectives.",10.1109/ISSE54508.2022.10005337,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

The recent unpredictability in various business process scenarios has high-lighted the need for collaboration and the advantages of participating. Edge computing facilitates segregation of computing responsibilities between edge devices and cloud infrastructure to process and analyze data. Researchers are working on reconfigurable edge computing systems based on varied technology solutions. We propose a software architectural framework to facilitate sustainability and evolvability in such ecosystems. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

2022,Reconfiguring the K-Drama Business Model: The Co-production of Mr. Sunshine by Netflix and Studio Dragon,"An engineered system is a composition of multiple entities. The existence of an engineered system is justified by purposes. The exposed system characteristics permit stakeholders to achieve these purposes. Systems are situated in their system context and may be evolved. Due to the digital revolution, a term which refers to the changes coming along with digital computing and communication technologies, there is an increased occurrence of Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) instead of pure cyber-physical systems (CPSs) or System of Systems (SoS). SoS and CPS are often denoted as smart systems if they can monitor their environment and adapt their behavior accordingly. Along with the evolution of systems across SoS and/or CPSs toward up-to-date CPSoS, the extent and number of relations between system elements increases. The development of system architectures is an important and fundamental task in Model-based Systems Engineering which can be applied to various types of systems, e.g. SoS, CPS, and CPSoS. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, corrected publication 2022.",10.1007/978-3-031-09374-6_4,,scopus
2010,Interaction-based Runtime Verification for Systems of Systems Integration,"Complex distributed systems pose great challenges for quality assurance. Size, complexity and concurrency of these systems often render traditional verification techniques impractical. In particular, this is true for systems integration efforts, where additional challenges arise from the independent evolution of the composed systems. Runtime verification provides a systematic strategy for analytical quality assurance of such systems. Key elements of runtime verification are system models, ways to inject these models into the observed system and a framework for analysing and monitoring the runtime behaviour against the models. The approach we present in this article is based on interaction models. We specify expected system interactions using Message Sequence Charts (MSC), from which we generate distributed runtime monitors for each of the components. We use aspect-oriented programming (AOP) techniques to inject the monitors into the implementation of the components. Thereby, we verify the adherence of the distributed system interactions with the MSC model. The focus of this article is the runtime verification in the systems integration domain; here, Enterprise Service Buses (ESB) have emerged as a powerful infrastructure for integrating complex distributed systems. In the context of an ESB we leverage the Spring AOP framework to inject the runtime monitors. As a result we obtain a comprehensive, tool-supported approach for model-based runtime verification of interactions. We demonstrate our approach using the Central Locking System as running example of an integrated embedded system.",10.1093/logcom/exn079,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8133355/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

2019,Architecting systems‐of‐systems and their constituents: A case study applying Industry 4.0 in the construction domain,"The development of system-of-systems (SoS) requires a continuous interplay between design decisions on the SoS level and those on the level of its constituent systems (CS), which often preexist and need to be adapted as the SoS evolves. This involves not only preparing the CS to participate in a particular SoS, but also designing the CS architecture to make it easily adaptable to a future SoS context. The problem is in part addressed in an emerging SoS framework in the manufacturing domain called Industry 4.0. It focuses on connected and digitalized production with the ambition of increasing flexibility and efficiency. This paper investigates how Industry 4.0 standards can be used in an SoS context to make CS more flexible and adaptive, and evaluates their usefulness outside manufacturing. The study is based on a case from the construction domain, for which a generic SoS architecture is developed. Several extensions and adaptations of Industry 4.0 are suggested, including specifications of ontologies for missions and workflows.",10.1002/sys.21516,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.21516,googlescholar
2021,System of Robotic Systems for Crack Predictive Maintenance,"In the built heritage, maintenance represents a not insignificant part of the costs of restoration and repair. Especially if this maintenance is carried out aperiodically. In this paper, we discuss a concept of System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), based on autonomous and collaborative robotization techniques. The latter is intended to detect, localise and repair microscopic cracks on flat wall surfaces. This was made possible by collaborating between several operational and managerial independent drones, one of which is intended to automatically detect cracks using the deep learning technique offered nowadays by Artificial Intelligence (AI). A second flying-manipulator robot, communicating and collaborative, manages to localise the cracks and deposit material continuously on the pruning shears of the crack. The whole concept works in a collaborative way and with an evolutionary development, in the presence of hazards and faults on one of the robotic system components. Experiments demonstrate the passage from the theory, in terms of architecture of the SoSE concept, as well as its robustness.",10.1109/SOSE52739.2021.9497490,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2021,Aerospace Human Systems Integration,"This chapter focuses on the evolution of human‐centered design (HCD) in aerospace systems over the last forty years. Human factors and ergonomics first shifted from the study of physical and medical issues to cognitive issues circa the 1980s. The advent of computers brought with it the development of human–computer interaction (HCI), which then expanded into the field of digital interaction design and user experience (UX). We ended up with the concept of interactive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but because they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the early 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the point that complex system design and management found itself center stage, with the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups. Today, human systems integration (HSI) is no longer only a single‐agent problem, but a multi‐agent research field. Systems are systems of systems, considered as representations of people and machines. They are made of statically and dynamically articulated structures and functions. When they are at work, they are living organisms that generate emerging functions and structures that need to be considered in evolution (i.e. in their constant redesign). This chapter will more specifically focus on human factors such as human‐centered systemic representations, life‐critical systems, organizational issues, complexity management, modeling and simulation, flexibility, tangibility, and autonomy. The discussion will be based on several examples in civil aviation and air combat, as well as aerospace.",10.1002/9781119698821.ch7,,ieeeexplore; wiley
2021,Applying model-based Co-Simulation on modular Production Units in Complex Automation Systems,"Contemporary manufacturing systems face major challenges driven by the ongoing integration of intelligent manufacturing components, mainly caused by the emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the interplay of those Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) itself forms a System of Systems (SoS), engineering such a system becomes a difficult task. This is mainly attributed to the evolutionary development of its independently operating components, which results in some kind of unpredictable and often undesirable behavior. Considering this from a developer’s perspective, it is important to investigate the system’s behaviors before its actual implementation. However, as methods applied in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) have proven to be a major technology driver when it comes to developing the architecture of these industrial systems, their simulation is still not standardized. Thus, this paper introduces an Industry 4.0 specific tool-chain enabling the co-simulation of components within any developed industrial system architecture. This allows the investigation of varying industrial CPS and their interplay during run-time with the goal to detect undesired emergent behaviors. By doing so, the model is developed regarding the specifications of the Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), while Mosaik is the tool of choice for creating the Co-Simulation environment. In order to validate the developed tool-chain, a case study utilizing modular production units within an industrial automation system is applied.",10.1109/ISSE51541.2021.9582531,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

This historical survey (Pereira et al., 2017) highlights the impact of digitalization both on isolated machines and devices, and on the architecting of large-scale manufacturing and logistics systems. To distribute the holistic control over related components, two main paradigms have been followed for the engineering of those System of Systems (SoS): (1) technology-enhanced, and (2) bio-inspired. In both, the cognitive orchestration of the knowledge and skills involved in a system project remains challenging for the interdisciplinary togetherness and harmony required beyond the disciplinary boundaries. Finally, lessons learned, as well as acquired knowledge through this innovative history are addressed with several open questions and emerging challenges related to the cyber-physical systems evolution.",10.1016/j.arcontrol.2019.01.002,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience

2020,Towards Employing ABM and MAS Integrated with MBSE for the Lifecycle of SCPSoS,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are natural evolutions of embedded systems consisting of embedded computing devices and networks interacting with physical processes and possibly with a human. By introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0, CPSs are used in an interconnected way each of which may belong to a different stakeholder, building a complex System of Systems (SoS) called CPSoS. These systems need to employ some techniques to transform the collected data to knowledge with which the system can make better decisions. These capabilities can create smart CPSoS or sCPSoS.However, these systems are highly complex from both structural and behavioural point of views. Naturally, there is a need for multiple abstraction levels using different paradigms to model these system, called Multi-Paradigm modeling (MPM).In this paper, the challenges and opportunities of using agent technologies, including intelligent agents, Agent-based modeling and Simulation (ABM), and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) (or Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)) in an integrated way with Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques are discussed to cover the whole lifecycle of sCPSoS, from simulation and analysis, to development, operation and monitoring.",10.1145/3417990.3421439,,acm; scopus

2020,SApHESIA: An agent-based model and a criticality-based heuristic for cooperatively coupling SoSs,"Problems to solve nowadays have never been so complex and are continuously increasing in complexity. In this context Systems of Systems (SoS) may be a solution but the study of such systems is far from over. An SoS is a complex system characterized by the particular nature of its components: the latter, which are systems, tend to be managerially and operationally independent as well as geographically distributed. This specific characterization led to re-think research fields of classic systems engineering, such as definition, taxonomy, modeling, architecting, etc. SoS architecting focuses on the way independent components of an SoS can be dynamically structured and can autonomously and efficiently modify their interactions in order to fulfill the goal of the SoS and to cope with the high dynamics of the environment. This paper contributes to the multi-agent and SoS research fields by proposing a new generic SoS model called SApHESIA which considers the SoS main characteristics found in the literature and extends the notion of environment and interactions between component systems. It also proposes a new SoS architecting procedure based on the Adaptive Multi-Agent System (AMAS) approach that advocates full cooperation between all the components of the SoS through the concept of criticality. This criticality is a measure, local to each component, expressing its difficulties to reach its local goals. In this procedure, the SoS architecture evolves to self-adapt to the dynamics of the environment in which it is plunged, while considering the respective local goals of its components. An instantiation of SApHESIA to two distinct cases studies from different domains (logistics and exploratory missions) is done to obtain two SoSs. These two SoS are then coupled to form a new SoS at an upper level. Evaluations of these SoSs show that their cooperation make each of them more efficient.",10.1016/j.scico.2020.102533,,sciencedirect

2020,Towards an UML-based SoS Analysis and Design Process,"Systems of Systems or SoSs are an emerging class of systems built from large-scale constituent systems, that are often heterogeneous, with independent management, goals and resources. The heterogeneity and managerial independence of the constituent systems is both a strength and a drawback of SoS engineering. Although, the individual systems of an SoS may operate autonomously, their interactions present and usually provide important emerging properties that are constantly evolving. Therefore, coordination and interaction within the SoS constituent systems gives rise to an emerging behavior which defines the SoS overall goal. However, this may lead to unpredictable behavior (arrival/departure, failure to fulfill commitments) of the SoS constituent systems. As a result, a well-defined process for SoS engineering; where missions, capabilities and mainly the expected interactions of the constituent systems are well-established, is missing. Our objective in the present work is to propose an UML-based SoS analysis and design process (USDP). The process is iterative and incremental and will be instrumented and documented with various diagrams to ensure clarity and understandability of the USDP artifacts. Besides, a meta-model for SoS modelling will be defined, it mainly defines the SoS structure in terms of constituent systems, theirs missions, capabilities, and interactions. With the aim of reducing the abstraction of interactions and in order to ensure a high interoperability, a precise and coherent definition of the interactions among the heterogenous constituent systems of an SoS is given to make the description of the SoS more truthful. From a practical point of view, we develop a graphical editor for modeling an SoS, based on the strengths of the MDE approach.",10.1109/ICAASE51408.2020.9380112,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2019,The System Life Cycle Turbine: A proposal for a Universal System Life Cycle Model in Aerospace and Defense,"Over decades many (product or system) life cycle models have evolved. More than 46 life cycle models from Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Systems Engineering (SE), and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) have been reviewed. Most models are from an engineering perspective. Hence, engineering topics are dominant in life cycle models. However, the complexity of modern systems demands more: Consideration for business, support, and operational aspects during life cycle; the visualization of system evolution, from an imaginary version and the digital twin to a (cyber-) physical system of systems; possible negative impact for performance of systems of systems through time drifts in production. Furthermore, Obsolescence Management (OM), Change Requests (CR), Midlife Upgrades (MLU) and Product Generation Engineering (PGE) trigger jumps from one life cycle phase to another. As a result, these 46 life cycle models have been consolidated into a new model which has been further developed to meet also the aforementioned requirements. The resulting model called System Life Cycle Turbine (SLCT) may be applied to different (hardware) systems (or products).

2019,A System Dynamics and Scenarios Framework for Architecting Product Design Goals for Changeability,"The design of changeable product architecture requires modeling the dynamic interaction between products and the sociotechnical sphere, in order to understand where changeability is needed. For example, a government approval of airport expansions will impact airline operations, and the design priorities of new airliners. The purpose of this paper is to develop an approach to determine design goals for a new product architecture in system of systems (SoS). These goals become dynamic, once linked to their underlying societal changes. The characteristic of the approach is to integrate system dynamics (SD) and scenario planning; thus, SD captures quantitative aspects of societal and product function dynamics, while scenarios provide a narrative explicating parameter choices, assumptions, and implications. In this paper, SD models include business and societal aspects to evaluate long-term profitability. Goal prioritization for a new product is obtained in the form of importance weights via global sensitivity analysis; these weights are highly dependent on external functions and risk attitude, and vary in time. A toy case study deals with modeling the household freezer's past evolution in an SoS to find evolving design priorities.

2019,Architecting federations of systems: A framework for capturing synergy,"This paper defines Federations of Systems, introduces a tailored architecting framework, and demonstrates it in a satellite design case study. While certainly not being new concepts in the literature, federations are a class of Systems of Systems (SoS) that have not been extensively explored due to the scarcity of applied examples and still few practitioners facing their specific design challenges. This is expected to change with the advent of the Internet of Things, Machine to Machine applications, collaborative consumption, and Federated Satellite Systems. It has become henceforth necessary to develop approaches in design and architecting capable of addressing such interconnected sets of systems. Federations are SoS characterized by the absence of global goals and stakeholders, and cooperation enabled only on an opportunistic basis. Systems engage in federations when the perceived benefit exceeds the costs of the necessary interfaces. The proposed framework quantifies the upper limits to the net benefits of cooperation between systems through the concept of synergy. Using synergy as a heuristic to navigate federated design spaces, the framework predicts the appearance and evolution of federations. The demonstration of the framework in a six-satellite federation shows that advantages of federating emerge with the collaboration between just two systems. Interface costs, architectural cost preferences, and network topology drive the achievable benefits. Specifically, when considering communication architectures under 80 MUSD for satellite systems, federating is advantageous when the interface lifecycle costs are below 15 MUSD. This demonstration case exemplifies how federating can assist systems in achieving design points that dominate the solutions of their local tradespace. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21482,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2019,Model and data-driven system portfolio selection based on value and risk,"System portfolio selection is a kind of tradeoff analysis and decision-making on multiple systems as a whole to fulfill the overall performance on the perspective of System of Systems (SoS). To avoid the subjectivity of traditional expert experience-dependent models, a model and data-driven approach is proposed to make an advance on the system portfolio selection. Two criteria of value and risk are used to indicate the quality of system portfolios. A capability gap model is employed to determine the value of system portfolios, with the weight information determined by correlation analysis. Then, the risk is represented by the remaining useful life (RUL), which is predicted by analyzing time series of system operational data. Next, based on the value and risk, an optimization model is proposed. Finally, a case with 100 candidate systems is studied under the scenario of anti-missile. By utilizing the Non-dominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) algorithm, a Pareto set with 200 individuals is obtained. Some characters of the Pareto set are analyzed by discussing the frequency of being selected and the association rules. Through the conclusion of the whole procedures, it can be proved that the proposed model and data-driven approach is feasible and effective for system portfolio selection. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/app9081657,,scopus; webofscience

Digital platform and digital ecosystem; [Концептуальная модель цифровой платформы для кибер-физического управления современным предприятием Часть 1. Цифровая платформа и цифровая экосистема],"The paper proposes conceptual model of a digital platform for cyber-physical management of modern enterprises in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focuses on automation of physical processes, Industry 5.0 is oriented on digitization of knowledge and automation of reasoning processes for creating artificial intelligence that is able to manage enterprises. This still emerging era will be characterized by the vision of any business, including industrial production or logistics, as a complex adaptive system built on fundamental principles of self-organization and evolution, as well as interaction of artificial intelligence systems and humans. The paper shows that implementation of such production and logistics management systems will require development of new models and decision-making methods based on knowledge and semantic information processing, integration of computational and communication components, accumulation of big data and its processing for predictive analytics, blockchain technologies for fixing mutual obligations of systems components in the form of smart contracts, as well as human-machine and software interfaces. Existing approaches to creation of digital platforms within the digital economy of Industry 4.0 and their limitations are analyzed. The concept of digital ecosystem is developed as an open, distributed, self-organized ""system of systems"" of smart services capable of coming up with solutions and automatically resolving conflicts through negotiations and concessions.

2018,Adaptation to extreme weather events in complex health and social care systems: The example of older people’s services in England,"Our findings contribute to a growing international literature on how conceptual models from complexity theory may be relevant to inform planning in health and social care systems, helping to adapt and improve preparedness and resilience to extreme weather events. We focus on findings from two case studies in England and their relationship to national policy for adaptation. Complexity theory helped to frame strategies for planning for events that are emergent and unpredictable. We find from our case studies that, in spite of the uncertainty involved, some ‘principles’ derived from parts of the literature on complexity theory may provide a helpful framework for the development of more robust preparedness strategies in the health and social care sector. By viewing health and social care as a ‘system of systems’, adaptation planning recognises the interrelationships of built, institutional and social infrastructures. The idea of local systems, with variable, path-dependent attributes, which are partially closed, but permeable to other parts of the wider network, leads to an actionable model of adaptation which emphasises the potential value of local self-organisation, but also underlines the importance of co-evolution across the wider system and the vital role of national initiatives and support for adaptation strategies.

2018,Required changes in requirements engineering approaches for socio-cyber-physical systems,"Requirements engineering has been mainly focused on software development, which represents relatively homogenous, stable and predictable cyber space. But even there, problems in requirements (e.g., changing, missing or irrelevant requirements) are considered as main reasons for project failure. Entering a new era of socio-cyber-physical systems, which are complex, heterogeneous systems of systems, will make requirements engineering even more challenging. Not only it is a standard practice that requirements change and evolve, and new requirements emerge frequently during the system life cycle. In socio-cyber-physical systems, requirements cannot be defined just for the cyber space, but must cover also the socio and physical spaces. There are also highly complex interrelationships, interactions and impacts between components of systems that can lead to unexpected and even unacceptable consequences in system structure and behaviour. One of the promising approaches supporting adaptability and emergency of systems is continuous requirements engineering, based on agility, flexibility and emergence. Therefore it is necessary to identify gaps in existing requirements engineering practices with respect to socio-cyber-physical systems and to propose required adjustments and enhancements in requirements engineering process.

2000,Joint strike fighter modeling and simulation: The continuing evolution,"From the beginning, JSF has applied M&S in the CAIV process to iterate to an affordable set of requirements for the United State's next generation strike fighter. Warfighters from the USAF, Navy, Marine Corps and the UK Royal Navy have been involved from the beginning, initially with constructive models, where the primary interaction was with PowerPoint slides and a few simple graphics programs. Now the warfighters are periodically brought into various simulation facilities to fly in real-time air-to-air and air-to-surface simulation events. As the JSF program progresses to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (HMD) phase, M&S will be a key player in cost, technical, and schedule risk reduction, Test and Evaluation, and continued CONOPS development. The current M&S toolset will also evolve to work with JSF's training environment, either stand alone or as an element of the Distributed Mission Training (DMT) federation. The Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) balances total ownership cost against system performance parameters. Every technology and operational capability must buy its way onto the system. The total ownership cost of a weapon system includes R&D, Acquisition, and Sustainment costs. The JSF Core Model Suite for the Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase includes Thunder, the Joint Interim Mission Model (JIMM), the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM), Brawler, Mosaic, Radguns, and the Enhanced Surface to Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS). This suite of models is managed through a robust Configuration Control Board with established criteria for model and database improvements, which are worked through the respective government model managers. In addition, the databases that feed these models are strictly managed through a Database Pedigree process. Recent M&S activities have focused on virtual, or pilotin-the-loop, simulation events. These events have taken place at Patuxent River NAS, MD, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Williams AFB, AZ, and Edwards AFB, CA. These activities fall into two categories, Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface. The Air-to-Air simulation environment used by JSF is the Man-in-the-Loop Air-to-Air System Performance Evaluation Model (MIL-AASPEM). The Air-to-Surface environment utilized by JSF is much more complicated. The Joint Interim Mission Model (JIMM) is used for the core simulation environment, the generic Pilot Vehicle Interface is called the Fighter Requirements Evaluation Demonstrator (FRED), and several ancillary programs are used for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Forward Looking Infrared (IR), and Out-the-Window (OTW) visual scene generation. These sensors all access a multi-spectral database enabling correlated SAR, IR, and OTW images. All of these M&S tools are continuously evolving to meet the needs of the program. Near term plans call for hardware-in-the-loop and System of Systems (SoS) experiments in preparation for HMD design trades and T&E, while working through training system support issues. Modeling and Simulation holds a key role in the JSF program-it is the only way to adequately design and test the complex subsystems and their interactions in a representative dense threat environment.",,,scopus
2018,Leadership and foresight in complex system governance,"Complex system governance (CSG) is an emerging field focused on addressing complex systems and related problems. CSG is related to system of systems engineering (SoSE) in that both are concerned with integration of multiple complex systems with the desired outcome of capabilities beyond those available by the individual systems. Specifically, CSG focuses on the design, evolution, and execution of (metasystem) functions essential for system operations and survival (viability). Included are functions for monitoring the system's environment and developing reactions to changes encountered therein. Foresight is a process to expand awareness and clarify emerging conditions. The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence foresight might have on the functions performed by the CSG environment monitoring and metasystem development/evolution subsystems, and the role of leadership in designing and enabling the means for those functions to be performed.

SoS architecting deals with the way that independent components of a SoS can be dynamically structured and can change autonomously their interactions in an efficient manner to fulfill the goal of the SoS and to cope with an evolving environment.In this context we defined a new model called SApHESIA (SoS Architecting HEuriStIc based on Agents) focusing on the environment and its dynamics. We also proposed a cooperative heuristic to control interactions exchanges between components. These contributions are then instantiated to a case study and evaluated through two scenarii.

2015,The Top 10 Illusions of Systems Engineering: A Research Agenda,"Traditional systems engineering is predicated upon prediction and control. Prediction is required to attain some degree of confidence that design and manufacture decisions will yield desired results. Control is necessary to ensure that subsystems meet the needs of the overarching system. While this paradigm was successful for decades, evolving circumstances have resulted in two challenges. First, the increasing complexity of systems has eroded the system engineer's ability to predict the outcome of his or her design decisions. Second, the need to interconnect existing systems in the form of a system of systems challenges the system engineer's ability to exercise technical control because of the operational and managerial independence of the constituent systems. The application of a process predicated on invalid assumptions is not likely to achieve desirable results. This paper presents the top 10 assumptions, which are often illusory in today's systems environment. Unfortunately, our current systems engineering practices are based on heuristics dependent on many of these assumptions, often in the context of aerospace and defense programs, that have been acquired during the past half century, rather than on a solid body of scientific knowledge and are inadequate to support the discipline's necessary transformation. Consequently, research is critical to create the foundations that can support a new paradigm for systems engineering, one that is based on the reality of engineering systems in which deterministic prediction and control are no longer possible in many circumstances.",10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.033,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002690,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2015,A robust portfolio optimization approach to system of system architectures,"The realization of military capability as a System of Systems (SoS), presents significant development challenges across technical, operational and programmatic dimensions. In particular, tools for deciding how to form and evolve SoS which consider performance and risk are lacking. This research leverages tools from financial engineering and operations research perspectives in portfolio optimization to assist decision making in this setting. Our approach facilitates evolutions of SoS architecture through a framework that supports architecture selection at a given decision-epoch of the evolutionary process. The approach models hierarchies of interdependent systems as generic nodes on a network that, subject to connectivity and compatibility constraints, work cohesively to fulfill overarching capability objectives. A robust portfolio algorithm is employed to address inherent real world issues of data uncertainty, inter-nodal performance and developmental risk. A naval warfare scenario illustrates application of the method to find ""portfolios"" of systems from a candidate list of available systems. Results show how the framework effectively reduces the combinatorial complexity of tradespace exploration (e.g., connectivity rules, feasibility of solutions, optimality of solutions) by allowing the optimization problem to handle the mathematically intensive aspects of the decision-making process. As a result, human decision-makers can focus on choosing the appropriate weights for risk aversion in making final decisions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21302,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2017,Case Study: Agile SE Process for Centralized SoS Sustainment at Northrop Grumman,"Abstract In 2015 Northrop Grumman's GCSS-J Systems Engineering group in Mclean, Virginia, supporting the DISA GCSS-J PMO, had been sustaining and evolving a critical information service portal for 12 independent user groups accessing 22 independent systems. This web-based portal is a centralized Systems-of-Systems (SoS) hub, dealing with unpredictable independent-system changes, mitigating immediate-priority security needs, and replacing uncontrollable obsolescence of COTS software elements – all the while deploying new capability in six month increments requested by expectant users. The systems engineering process combines elements of Scrum, and contract waterfall requirements simultaneously on three release instances, one in development, one in accreditation test, and one in deployed use – with a wave-like transition among the three instances every six months. The process had six years of effective employment and evolution, winning praise from GAO and users alike. Most notable is the real-time control model for re-prioritizing work-in-process, the intimate involvement of customer and users in the agile systems engineering process, and the never-ending evolution with all life-cycle stages in simultaneous activity.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2017.00349.x,,wiley

2017,Knowledge amplification by structured expert randomization-KASERs in SoS design,"The U.S. Army needs robotic combat vehicles that can autonomously navigate the battlefield and carry out planned missions that necessarily embody unplanned details. On one end of the spectrum lie the simple insect-like robots that have been popularized by Brooks at MIT [1]. Their simple behaviors can be evolved much in the same manner as a simple program can be created through the use of chance alone. Of course, more complex behaviors cannot be tractably evolved, because the search space here grows exponentially. What is needed are heuristics to guide the evolutionary process. We can, of course, program search strategies and have indeed programmed robots to perform a myriad of complex functions-from the robot Manny’s (U.S. Army) ability to walk the battlefield to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). What is needed is a means to program more complex and reliable functionality for constant cost. That is, a system of systems (SoS) is needed. For example, one can program a robotic vehicle to sense and avoid an obstacle on the right, say. But then, what is the cost of programming the same robot to sense and avoid an obstacle on the left? It should be less, and is to some extent if object-oriented component-based programs are written. The problem here, though, is that the cost is front loaded. The programmer needs to know a priori most of the domain symmetries if he or she is to capture them in the form of objects. A better solution is to do for symbolic programming what fuzzy logic did for Boolean logic [2,3]. That is, we need the programmer to be able to constrain the robot’s behavior in the form generalized actions. Then, instances of these generalizations constitute the desired program. Even search-control heuristics can be acquired through the exercise of this paradigm. Instead of programming the robot to do a specific action, we program the robot to (heuristically) search a space of actions for one or more that is consistent with environmental constraints. The writing of such programs is easier for the human, and the constraints that instantiate them serve to render the search space tractable for the machine. © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1201/9781420065893,,scopus

2016,Genetic Algorithm Optimization of SoS Meta-Architecture Attributes for Fuzzy Rule Based Assessments,"The analysis of an acknowledged systems of systems (SoS) meta-architecture requires a preliminary method for potential trade space exploration to ensure compliance to evolving capability requirements. It is important to assess the SoS meta-architecture concept to ensure that it satisfies all stakeholder needs and requirements in the early stages of development. There are numerous linguistic terms called key performance attributes (KPAs) that could be used to assess the different aspects of the architectures capabilities, however, too many KPAs could complicate the assessment. The initial population of suitable KPAs is reduced through non-derivative based optimization employed by a genetic algorithm (GA) that generates the ideal KPA candidates though optimal rank selection. A Mamdani-type rule based fuzzy inference system (MRBFIS) is then used to make a fuzzy assessment of the SoS meta-architecture concept using GA optimized and assessed KPAs as MRBFIS inputs. The MRBFIS is a beneficial addition to an architecture assessment because it enables a nonlinear output that allows a more dynamic and adjustable assessment. The integrated assessment method detailed in this paper utilizes the GA optimized KPAs and the MRBFIS to provide a valuable fuzzy assessment of SoS meta-architecture concepts to determine if the architecture is feasible and acceptable.",10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.298,,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience

2016,ENGINEERING THE VIRTUAL OR COLLABORATIVE SOS,"ABSTRACT The largest, most complex, and most prevalent systems of systems (SoS) are virtual or collaborative in nature. In such a SoS, there is no central authority to perform systems engineering. Yet, the virtual or collaborative SoS does grow, adapt, and evolve in response to the needs of the many stakeholders. Changes in the SoS happen because of many changes in the constituent systems (CS), with each change occurring when the CS owners deem it useful to change. The systems engineering activities in the CS can be used to guide and affect the SoS through a collaborative and competitive environment in which each CS systems engineer seeks to optimize the SoS behavior for their own purposes. This requires a different approach to the systems engineering activities, in which greater emphasis is on the higher-level analysis, architecting, and quantification. This paper describes the modified systems engineering approach, showing how to engineer the SoS from within the scope of a CS.",10.1002/inst.12113,,wiley

It addressed the development of new methods and tools supporting the Design for Adaptability and evolutioN in Systems of systems Engineering (SoSE). The DANSE consortium consists of 12 European organizations including large system integrators in the aerospace/ defence and electronics domain, engineering software tool vendors, and research organisations in the domain of embedded systems. The article provides an overview and short introduction to the large set of tangible results of the project. One of the key assets the project developed was a cohesive methodology that defines the role of SoSE as integral part of an evolutionary, adaptive, and iterative SoS lifecycle. The methods and tools elaborated along this methodology are based on the concept of contracts as semantically-sound models for SoS interoperations allowing a step change in architecting approaches for SoS – supporting continuous and non-disruptive constituent system integration. More public and detailed information about the project can be also obtained on the official DANSE website (www.danse-ip.eu).",10.1002/inst.12110,,wiley
2015,Variability Management for a Runtime Monitoring Infrastructure,"Many software systems today are systems of systems (SoS), which are difficult to analyze due to their size, complexity, heterogeneity, and variability. For instance, unexpected behavior of SoS is often caused by the complex interactions between the involved systems and their environment at runtime. Monitoring infrastructures (MIs) provide support for engineers and support staff analyzing the behavior of SoS during development and operation. Variability plays an important role in MIs, however, while some approaches exist, managing variability of MIs remains challenging. In this paper, we describe how we applied a variability management approach to support the reconfiguration of a SoS monitoring infrastructure (MI) at runtime. Our approach provides configuration support for setting up the MI to reflect system variability. It also supports runtime reconfiguration of the MI to reflect the different monitoring tasks of users and to support evolution. We motivate our work using the case of monitoring a real-world SoS from the domain of industrial automation and discuss variability-related challenges in four monitoring scenarios. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to these scenarios. We also demonstrate that our approach reduces manual reconfiguration effort and helps to reduce the overhead of the MI.",10.1145/2701319.2701330,,acm; scopus

2015,Simulation-based analysis of reconfigurable system of system Network topologies for resilience using Bayesian Networks,"An emerging understanding of resilient systems is as a management principle or framework allowing for reconfiguration or adaptation in the face of threats or shocks. This is a new approach engineered system resilience: the more traditional approach is that systems may focus on resistance to threats, and speedy recovery if vulnerabilities are breached. This notion can potentially integrate interdisciplinary research currently pursued in systems engineering, design theory, infrastructure risk analysis, and statistical learning to create an approach that permits both evaluation of system resilience and also the value of system evolvability in the face of operational hazards. In prior work, a vision for reconfigurable systems based on Bayesian Networks was articulated but not tested or demonstrated. In this paper, we demonstrate a Bayesian Network inspired approach to measuring the value of re-configurability in systems of systems that can be represented in directed acyclic graphs using a simulation-based approach. For the purpose of our investigation, re-configurability means that a system can adapt its structure to structural failures in either system components or links between components. The latter is called structural flexibility, whereas the former is called functional flexibility. Undirected Bayesian Networks are used to structure the relationships between the subsystem components, and the graphical model is then used in conjunction with concepts from functional dependency network theory to evaluate the response the system under updated configurations.",,,scopus
2014,3.2.2 Traceable Engineering of Fault-Tolerant SoSs,"Abstract Systems of systems (SoSs) are characterised by a challenging combination of continuous evolution, emergent behaviour and distributed, autonomous and independent constituents. The development of SoSs that can tolerate faults and harmful events is hampered by these and other complexities. Currently there is little in the way of methods or tools to help SoS developers to design fault-tolerant SoSs. In this paper we present a structured approach for capturing requirements for a fault-tolerant SoS and a fault modelling architectural framework (FMAF) that supports disciplined and reusable development of fault-tolerant architectures. We also provide a traceable mapping of the fault-tolerant requirements into SoS architectural designs. Finally we apply our techniques to a real-world SoS case study.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2014.tb03148.x,,wiley
2014,The Role of Information and Communication Technology in the Development of Early Warning Systems for Geological Disasters: The Tsunami Show Case,"Tsunami warning systems (TWS) are distributed software and hardware systems supporting the reliable detection of imminent tsunami hazards, the rapid situation assessment and the targeted dissemination of customised warning messages. The conceptual evolution of TWS within the last decades is stimulated by and depending on the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The strong influence of ICT emerged in the 1980s when the availability of microcomputer systems and telecommunication facilities facilitated the development of global sensor networks. Since the 1990 s the growth of the Internet has driven standardisation processes for protocols, interfaces and data exchange, providing the foundations for today’s TWS. The ongoing development of global warning infrastructures depends on the capability to integrate national and local TWS into system-of-systems. This requires structured software engineering methodologies guided by a reference architecture for TWS. Trends such as cloud computing, ubiquitous sensing and volunteered geographic information will strongly influence the future development of TWS.",10.1007/978-3-642-12233-0_12,,springerlink

But from the perspective of capability assessment, there is still no effective fundamental measure that can scientifically reflect the typical characteristics of the SoS. In this study, from the view of “structure, state, evolution”, firstly proposed a fundamental measure framework for SoS's capability, which includes performance or effectiveness measure, SoS topology measure and state evolution measure; secondly presented the paradigms and algorithm of the fundamental measures on the analysis of capability-generating structures and capability state evolution of the complex SoS.

2014,Towards an Ontology of SoS Interoperability: Proposition of a SoS Interoperability Framework and a SoS Conceptual Interoperability Model,"Systems engineering is currently evolving to extend beyond the scope of a single system. Recently, the increasing number of interacting systems in society and industry generated a growing interest in a class of complex systems, called Systems of Systems (SoS), whose components are complex and independent. There is a growing interest for the creation of synergies between these component systems to achieve the desired performance of the overall system (SoS). The SoS approach is intended to build and analyze complex, independent and heterogeneous systems working (or designed to work) in cooperation. The SoS concept presents a high level perspective that explains the interactions between the independent systems. In the context of SoS engineering, interoperability is one of the most challenging problems. The aim of this paper is to present an interoperability framework and a conceptual model to formally structure knowledge about SoS Engineering and build an Ontology of SoS Interoperability (OoSoSI).",10.1007/978-3-319-07215-9_7,,springerlink

2013,Composing Distributed Systems: Overcoming the Interoperability Challenge,"Software systems are increasingly composed of independently-developed components, which are often systems by their own. This composition is possible only if the components are interoperable , i.e., are able to work together in order to achieve some user task(s). However, interoperability is often hampered by the differences in the data types, communication protocols, and middleware technologies used by the components involved. In order to enable components to interoperate despite these differences, mediators that perform the necessary data translations and coordinate the components’ behaviours appropriately, have been introduced. Still, interoperability remains a critical challenge for today’s and even more tomorrow’s distributed systems that are highly heterogeneous and dynamic. This chapter introduces the fundamental principles and solutions underlaying interoperability in software systems with a special focus on protocols. First, we take a software architecture perspective and present the fundamentals for reasoning about interoperability and bring out mediators as a key solution to achieve protocol interoperability. Then, we review the solutions proposed for the implementation, synthesis, and dynamic deployment of mediators. We show how these solutions still fall short in automatically solving the interoperability problem in the context of systems of systems. This leads us to present the solution elaborated in the context of the European Connect project, which revolves around the notion of emergent middleware, whereby mediators are synthesised on the fly. We consider the GMES (Global Monitoring of Environment and Security) initiative and use it to illustrate the different solutions presented.",10.1007/978-3-642-40615-7_6,,springerlink

SoS has used a number of concepts from complexity theory, such as inclusion of autonomous and independent systems and emergence. However, there are a number of other concepts that have not been so readily used in SoSE which have been clearly enunciated in complex systems research papers. These include self organization, complexity leadership, stability levels and notions of being on the edge of chaos, phase history and initial conditions, co-evolution, hierarchy versus networked, and redundant resources. These concepts are examined and some implications for use in SoSE proposed. Although it is considered desirable to include these in SoSE architecture, it is concluded that SoSE architecture is not adequately developed so inclusion in processes to be used in SoSE architecture is the best approach.",10.1109/SYSoSE.2013.6575249,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2013,Incorporating Architecture Patterns in a SoS Optimization Framework,"Creation and management of large complex systems of systems (SoS) can be a daunting task for even the most experienced engineers. Architecting these systems requires considerable domain expertise and next generation tools to seamlessly link requirements elicitation, through to modeling and simulation, and finally through to implementation. The resulting SoS can be so complex that it is virtually impossible for a single person to understand all its interactions. An important aid to this process is the use of architecture patterns that provide blueprints for proven elements of a system that can be incorporated into the evolution of a system or service. This paper describes a novel approach in validating architecture patterns during the early phases of service or product design and development. We propose an architecture optimization method called Concise Modeling to be used in conjunction with architecture patterns to expedite SoS architecture exploration and analysis.",10.1109/SMC.2013.297,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Additionally, we have to deal with independence of constituent systems (CS) of SoS, in particular, managerial independence. In this article we focus on technical challenges of mastering SoS requirements.

The approach of software system development is called Federated Embedded Systems (FES) and their revolved ecosystem of players is presented, aiming to ensure quality in engineering SoS. Ecosystems for Federated Embedded Systems (EcoFES) comprise a new area of research that scales component-based software development for embedded software into new dimensions. The proposed ecosystem dimension introduces an open, flexible and adaptable SoS architecture for improving the process of FES development.

2012,A semantic mediation framework for architecting federated ubiquitous systems,"Despite 20 years of research, ubiquitous systems have yet to become truly ubiquitous. A key challenge is the design for volatility and evolution experienced when those systems are deployed in more than one environment as well as for a substantial time period. The work presented here describes a proposed federated System of Systems (SoS) engineering approach for creating ubiquitous systems based on service-oriented principles. Service orientation is becoming more common for SoS implementation as it supports operational independence, managerial independence, and geographic distribution of constituent systems. However, in a virtual SoS, there is no central management authority and centrally agreed purpose, making interface standardization and integration of capabilities a difficult task. In this paper, we approach this problem by proposing a conceptual ontology-based semantic mediation framework to orchestrate the system engineering activities related to publishing constituent system capabilities during the design stage of the lifecycle, and enable automating capability discovery, selection, and composition at runtime.",10.1109/SYSoSE.2012.6384130,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6384130/,ieeeexplore; scopus; googlescholar

The proposed interdisciplinary approach combines theories of complexity and social sciences with those developed for systems and networks to: theorize problems of Extended Enterprise Systems (EES); explore how they are governed; and study how their governance structure strives for effectiveness over time. ESG adopts qualitative insights from complexity theories fundamentals, organizational behavior studies, systems thinking tools, and social sciences, and supports them with quantitative procedures and techniques such as agent-based modeling, social network analysis, dynamic systems analysis, and game theory to create new set of methodologies, tailored for governing EES. We believe that ESG can be expanded to become a new field of science that will address the need for a fundamental understanding of how organizational architectures evolve around technological systems and processes to generate complex network-based structures. It will also offer effective and holistic solutions to resolve major challenges regarding the governance of socio-technological and large-scale extended enterprises, SoS, and adaptive complex systems, such as the financial system as well as development programs and infrastructure systems.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482432,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5482432/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

Modern weapons have become enormously complex internetworked systems of systems, technology is evolving at an increasing rate, and current acquisition practices may be exacerbating poor program performance. Lean and agile acquisition and systems engineering practices are emerging to help overcome the challenges of rapidly fielding complex new systems in the face of dynamic and uncertain market conditions and ever increasing military and intelligence threats in order to satisfy enterprise and mission needs today. Lean and agile acquisition and systems engineering as we know it today is a relatively new paradigm for managing high-risk, time-sensitive, research and development-oriented new product development projects. It seems to be the ideal model for modern, post-industrial information age knowledge workers. In reality, however, it has a long and rich history and lineage. Its tenets can be traced back to Roman Infantry Tactics, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Sir Isaac Newton, and the principles of experimentation used by Louis Pasteur in the 1800s and Thomas Edison in the early 1900s.

2010,Constructing program management framework,"Programs are aimed at achieving long term objectives that create value to stakeholders. They consist of a portfolio of projects, each of which aims at achieving specific sub-goals. A program emerges as a system of systems (SoS) when these projects are connected in a systemic way to accomplish program objectives. This entails that programs have an architecture that defines how the various projects interact to accomplish the overall objectives. Current program management approaches, however, largely treat programs as a collection of projects that are managed operationally to optimize outcomes at each level, rather than as a system to be architected. This paper develops a systemic architecture for programs in terms of three interconnected facets: value realization, program construction and program execution, and highlights the role of program worldview in this. Each of these facets brings out some aspects of the way in which projects relate to each other within a program. We propose an iterative framework in which models are developed for addressing each facet, but there is also an overall structure of activity and information flows that facilitates interplay and co-evolution of the models. The result is a holistic approach to managing programs as a system of systems, at a level over and above project management.",10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482471,,ieeeexplore
2008,Autonomous Farming: Modeling and Control of Agricultural Machinery in a Unified Framework,"Currently, there are significant challenges faced by the farming industry, not least of which are a reduction in the available labour workforce, and a more 'corporate' style of farming. Such factors demand an increase in farming efficiency and productivity. This paper looks forward to the not too distant future, where the realisation of autonomous farming will aid in the farming communities surviving as well as competing in the global market. In this work, the autonomous farm is seen as a complex system-of-systems, where there is necessarily a seamless integration of requirements, bringing together the areas of robotics for autonomous farming, and precision agriculture (PA), which deals with issues of agronomy. In essence, agricultural robotics uses on-farm sensing and control to actuate autonomous farm machinery with the aim of satisfying agronomy-based objectives. We initially describe a system-of-systems architecture, or unified framework, where a vital building block is the existence of two data sets used as links, or communication, between the various sub-systems. These data sets include a precision farming data set (PFDS) formed off-line before crop cultivation, containing spatially precise navigation data for any and all autonomous machinery, and a precision agriculture data set (PADS), which is a continually evolving entity consisting more of agronomy data in relation to the crop. Secondly, research undertaken in autonomous farm machinery is highlighted, where we present a foundation for the autonomous and robust control of articulated farm vehicles for real-time trajectory tracking in the presence of uncertain conditions. Preliminary results are shown, highlighting the autonomous control of vehicles for the operations of crop seeding and non-herbicidal weeding.",10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749583,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Different from the Internet Protocol which is designed for a large scale, general-purpose systems, CPS-IP is designed for special- purpose CPS systems built on critical infrastructure which requires global regulation and performance assurance for cyber physical interaction.

2009,A sos perspective of critical infrastructure systems development,"Critical infrastructural systems are complex systems of systems (SoS). Taking a SoS perspective of largescale infrastructural development can be beneficial in better understanding the inherent problems of emergent complexity. SoS is a relatively new term that is being applied primarily to addressing large scale inter-disciplinary developmental challenges with multiple, heterogeneous, and distributed networkcentric systems. A large-scale infrastructural system can be hierarchically structured from its building blocks to higher multi-levels of network. An infrastructural SoS is usually developed in evolutionary stages integrating existing systems with upgraded or extended systems. Complex infrastructural systems are non-monolithic and they share certain common characteristics which can be developed into a set of discriminators to develop a framework for SoS engineering management addressing issues in an evolutionary planning and staged development, stakeholder management and leadership for complex systems integration. The framework is then used to compare with and appreciate the observed characteristics of real-world major infrastructural development using Singapore-based case examples. © 2009 by KT Yeo.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2009.tb00956.x,,scopus; wiley

2008,Software cost estimation for Fractionated Space Systems,"Fractionated Space Systems, as exemplified by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Future Fast, Flexible, Fractionated, Free-Flying Spacecraft united by Information eXchange (DARPA's System F6), represent real challenges to software cost estimation. The concept is a traditional 'monolithic' spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly interconnected spacecraft modules to create a virtual satellite, delivering capability which is at least equivalent to the monolithic spacecraft. Concurrently, they significantly enhance flexibility and system robustness, and reduce risk throughout the mission life and the spacecraft development cycle. Such systems present real challenges to software cost estimation which arise from both the concept of a Directed System of Systems (DSOS) and the reduced risk which is primarily achievable only through the application of an Incremental Commitment Model (ICM). This paper will briefly introduce a next-generation synthesis of the spiral model and other leading process models into the ICM, which is being piloted or considered for adoption in some parts of Department of Defense (DoD). The ICM emphasizes architecting systems (or DSOSs) to encapsulate subsystems (or systems) undergoing the most rapid change; and architecting the incremental development process by having agile systems engineers handling longer-range change traffic to rebaseline the plans for future increments while largely plandriven teams develop and continuously verify and validate (V&V) the current increment, as is usually required for safe or secure software. One approach being followed for estimating the software development cost of the Fractionated Space Craft Systems of Systems (FSSOS) is based on the Constructive Incremental Commitment Cost Model (COINCOMO) model and its tool which currently implements together in one tool the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO II), the Constructive Phased Schedule and Effort Model (COPSEMO) and a Constructive Security Cost Model (COSECMO). COINCOMO has an added super-structure to accommodate multiple suppliers of independent software subsystems and multiple builds (or incremental deliveries). Many software systems components today rely on Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) sub-components and/or reuse of (potentially proprietary) open-source or legacy components which are treated like COTS components rather than reused, modified components, and adapted/reused open-source subcomponents, as well as new code. The COINCOMO model also accommodates them without the name-space explosion that happened in COCOMO II. COINCOMO 2.0 is implemented in a database-centric fashion designed with the ability to save and reuse any of the sets of parameters thus making it much easier to do what-if and evolving estimates.

2008,Systems Thinking for the Enterprise: A Thought Piece,"This paper suggests a way of managing the acquisition of capabilities for large-scale government enterprises that is different from traditional “specify and build” approaches commonly employed by U.S. government agencies in acquiring individual systems or systems of systems (SoS). Enterprise capabilities evolve through the emergence and convergence of information and other technologies and their integration into social, institutional and operational organizations and processes. Enterprise capabilities evolve whether or not the enterprise has processes in place to actively manage them. Thus the critical role of enterprise system engineering (ESE) processes should be to shape, enhance and accelerate the “natural” evolution of enterprise capabilities. ESE processes do not replace or add a layer to traditional system engineering (TSE) processes used in developing individual systems or SoS. ESE processes should complement TSE processes by shaping outcome spaces and stimulating interactions among enterprise participants through marketlike mechanisms to reward those that create innovation which moves and accelerates the evolution of the enterprise.",10.1007/978-3-540-85081-6_69,,springerlink
2007,Assessing hybrid incremental processes for SISOS development,"Abstract New processes are being assessed to address modern challenges for Software-Intensive Systems of Systems (SISOS), such as coping with rapid change while simultaneously assuring high dependability. A hybrid agile and plan-driven process based on the spiral lifecycle has been outlined to address these conflicting challenges with the need to rapidly field incremental capabilities in a value-based framework. A system dynamics model has been developed to assess the incremental hybrid process and support project decision making. It estimates cost and schedule for multiple increments of a hybrid process that uses three specialized teams, and also considers the mission value of software capabilities. It considers changes due to external volatility and feedback from user-driven change requests, and dynamically reestimates and allocates resources in response to the volatility. Deferral policies and team sizes can be experimented with, and it includes trade off functions between cost and the timing of changes within and across increments, length of deferral delays, and others. We illustrate how the model can be used to determine optimal agile team size to handle changes. Both the hybrid process and simulation model are being evolved on a very large scale incremental SISOS project and other potential pilots.

2007,Using Signatures of Self-Organisation for Monitoring and Influencing Large Scale Autonomic Systems,"The complexity of large distributed systems makes the monitoring, necessary for self governance and autonomic functions, very problematic. Systems will be ordered hierarchically, consisting of systems of systems. Furthermore a system may be constructed from systems that are fundamentally different in topology from itself. This means that a monitoring strategy that is successful in one part of the system will not necessarily perform well in another system sector. This work considers a phase transition through four system topologies, observed to occur in the evolution of many self organising systems, starting at a regular circular 2D lattice to a scale-free phase. The best monitoring strategy for a scale-free system is considered with a form of acquaintance monitoring proposed. Thus when a system is observed to be acting in a scale-free manner the most suitable monitoring strategy can be deployed.

2005,Extending NASA Earth-sun system research results to serve GEOSS societal benefits,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) share a common vision and mission to serve society through Earth observation systems. Beginning in the early 1960s, research and development programs conducted by NASA included Earth observation spacecraft focused on improving the capacity to monitor the weather; weather is now one of the societal benefit areas identified by the GEO. From the 1980s through 2004, NASA developed and deployed the Earth Observing System to conduct global research using measurements from the Terra, Aqua, and Aura spacecraft. The research results from these and other NASA space-based observatories are pathfinders for next-generation operational systems and are information sources for evolving computer models used to improve predictions of weather, climate, and natural hazards. Improved understanding of climate change and the prediction and preparedness associated with disasters are two additional societal benefit areas of the GEO. One of NASA's goals is to extend benefits of space research to improve scientific understanding of the Earth system and to demonstrate new technologies with the potential to improve future operational systems. NASA focuses on applications of national priority to transition these benefits systematically, enabling and improving integrated system solutions that inform decisions to serve society. Management of energy, coastal and biological ecosystems, agriculture, water, and human health are applications served by integrating NASA research results into solutions that are consistent with GEO societal benefit areas. NASA and the GEO share a common framework architecture to systematically apply Earth observations and predictions to enable decision support for specific applications areas. Over the next 10 years, NASA plans to continue collaborations with its U.S. and international partners to develop and deploy innovative research spacecraft and instruments.

2005,Obsolescence management for system-of-system: Hierarchies - a technology-based approach,"Many systems face a similar obsolescence issue, which is that the desired system deployment life cycle is much longer than the life cycle of the constituent parts (hardware and software) that make up the physical architecture. Thus, the system baseline must evolve over its operational life cycle just to remain functionally viable. This problem is compounded as the size of the system grows toward network-centric system-of-systems and as the use of commercial technologies and products increases. Thus, the challenge is to perform technology assessments that facilitate the forward planning of technology evolution on the system of interest. A corollary challenge is to perform this planning while simultaneously optimizing the life cycle affordability for the customer. This paper provides a methodology for taking current technology information and transforming it into a system evolution plan (the term system being used in the most general sense to encompass sub-assemblies through system-of-systems) using affordability as the optimizing variable for technology change incorporation. © 2005 by Lockheed Martin Corporation.",,,scopus
2005,5.2.3 Obsolescence Management for System-of-System Hierarchies – A Technology-based Approach,"Abstract Many systems face a similar obsolescence issue, which is that the desired system deployment life cycle is much longer than the life cycle of the constituent parts (hardware and software) that make up the physical architecture. Thus, the system baseline must evolve over its operational life cycle just to remain functionally viable. This problem is compounded as the size of the system grows toward network-centric system-of-systems and as the use of commercial technologies and products increases. Thus, the challenge is to perform technology assessments that facilitate the forward planning of technology evolution on the system of interest. A corollary challenge is to perform this planning while simultaneously optimizing the life cycle affordability for the customer. This paper provides a methodology for taking current technology information and transforming it into a system evolution plan (the term system being used in the most general sense to encompass sub-assemblies through system-of-systems) using affordability as the optimizing variable for technology change incorporation.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2005.tb00705.x,,wiley
1968,Possibilities of articulation of information systems into a network,"Abstract The interconnection of systems into a network permits sharing of effort in certain respects so that, from an input—output viewpoint, only 14 types of systems for handling serial literature are possible; it is believed that systems for handling separate literature are identical, nearly identical, or closely equivalent. Each of the 14 system types produces a different combination of outputs for use by its clientele or by other systems. When the variations in combinations of outputs transmitted between pairs of system types are examined, it is concluded that only 13 different modes of such communication—i.e., “modes of articulation”—are possible. Further, the 14 types of systems constitute only six overall groups; all system types within a group interact with each other system type in identical ways. Finally, the 13 modes of articulation can be organized into hierarchies, with the more general modes subsuming the more specific modes—pointing to the possibilities of (1) planned routes for evolutionary development of systems' articulative capabilities and (2) the need for only a very few standard procedures of articulation from which the more specific modes may be excerpted. In short, articulation among information systems for handling serial literature is not technically complex on the “system of systems” level (i.e., determining what is to be done) once the requirements of the clientele of the individual component systems have been determined. The matter of determining how to implement the what, however, may well be technically and sociopolitically difficult, and perhaps even economically impracticable.",10.1002/asi.5090190214,,wiley
,ISO/IEC/IEEE International Draft Standard - Systems and Software Engineering -- Guide for the Utilization of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 in the Context of System of Systems Engineering,"This document provides guidance on the application of processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 to systems of systems (SoS). The scope of this document is the same as ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, which addresses more than systems engineering activities.This document provides general guidance for each ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 process and process outcome in the context of SoS, but it does not address specific activities, tasks, methods, or procedures. Additional processes and process outcomes unique to SoS can still be needed and are not covered by this document.This document explores the similarities and differences between systems and SoS and, by extension, the similarities and differences between engineering of systems and SoS. The guidance contained in this document is expected to evolve as the discipline matures.",,,ieeeexplore
2022,Framework for Complex SoS Emergent Behavior Evolution Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Abstract Advances in technology have made it easy to integrate multiple modern systems to form complex system-of-systems (SoS) to achieve unparalleled levels of functionality that are otherwise not achievable by the constituent systems in isolation. In fact, with the recent explosion of machine learning techniques to build autonomous systems such as drones and self-driving cars, there is a pressing need to ensure that they collaboratively and safely operate in an SoS context. However, in general, the characteristic emergent behaviors of complex SoS – that directly impact its operational measures of success or Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) – is very difficult, if not impossible, to manually explore, anticipate, and arbitrate just from knowledge of its underlying systems. Further, there are multiple scenarios of evolution in such complex SoS, including evolution in the emergent behavior of the SoS. The continuous, continual, and evolving nature of the SoS and constituent system environment's state and possible actions, adds further complexity. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning approach, to inculcate adaptable intelligence in constituent systems to adapt their behaviors in tandem with the evolution of emergent behavior at the SoS level. By augmenting the reward mechanism of RL by leveraging SoS-Constituent System MOE Relationship, that relates and ranks System MOEs vs. SoS MOEs, we inculcate an Intelligent-Behavior Evolution Agent, with the necessary constraints to learn to maximize the SoS and system-level MOEs, while adapting itself to the evolution in SoS. We illustrate our approach and demonstrate its feasibility and potential by applying it to a power grid SoS case example. The effectiveness and performance of the approach are quantified.",10.1002/iis2.12965,,wiley
2022,"Realizing the Promise of Digital Engineering: Planning, Implementing, and Evolving the Ecosystem","Abstract Gaining benefits of Digital Engineering is not only about implementing digital technologies. An ecosystem for innovation is a system of systems in its own right, only partly engineered, subject to risks and challenges of evolving socio-technical systems. This paper summarizes an aid to planning, analyzing, implementing, and improving innovation ecosystems. Represented as a configurable model-based Reference pattern used by collaborating INCOSE working groups, it was initially applied in targeted INCOSE case studies, and subsequently elaborated and applied to diverse commercial and defense ecosystems. Explicating the recurrent theme of Consistency Management underlying all historical engineering, it is revealing of Digital Engineering's special promise, and enhances understanding of historical as well as future engineering and life cycle management. It includes preparation of human and technical resources to effectively consume and exploit digital information assets, not just create them, capability enhancements over incremental release trains, and evolutionary steering using feedback and group learning.",10.1002/iis2.12985,,wiley
