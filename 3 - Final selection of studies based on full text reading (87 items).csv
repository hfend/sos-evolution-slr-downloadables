2022,Reinforcement Learning based System-of-Systems Approach for UAV Swarms Behavioral Evolution,"Advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies have enabled the development of biologically inspired swarms or fleets of UAVs that collaboratively achieve common mission objectives such as in surveillance and remote sensing applications. Typically, such swarms comprise of homogeneous UAVs that are developed using same techniques to serve the same purpose. However, the recent proliferation of UAV development by numerous research and commercial entities, using varied machine learning models to serve diverse purposes, has induced the need to rethink swarm development using heterogeneous UAVs that can adapt and achieve common objectives despite differences in their design and associated intelligence. In this paper, we present a novel approach to develop swarms of heterogeneous UAVs as System-of-Systems (SoS), and enabling behavioral evolution and adaptation of constituent UAVs through Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. The proposed approach involves SoS-Constituent System Measures Of Effectiveness Relationship (SSMR) model that correlates the Measures Of Effectiveness (MOEs) for the SoS with the MOEs of the constituent system UAVs. By formulating the SSMR as the reward mechanism of RL, our approach incorporates an Intelligent-Behavior Evolution Agent with the necessary constraints to learn to maximize the SoS and system-level MOEs, while adapting itself to the evolution in the swarm SoS. The initial experimental results indicate that our approach adequately trains these independent agents to be used in heterogeneous swarms.",10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773900,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2022,Research on Architecture of System-of-Systems Evolution Method Based on Bi-level Multi-objective Programming Model,"In the life cycle, the System-of-Systems is faced with challenges from internal and external uncertain factors, making it adapt to the environment through evolution. Studying Architecture of System-of-Systems evolution method is order to cope with the challenges of high-level mission change, replacement of old and new systems, and technical iterative update. An architecture evolution process is proposed to analyze evolutionary motivations and requirements. A bi-level multi-objective programming model is constructed to solve the Pareto optimal solution set that meets the evolutionary requirements. The genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, and the TOPSIS algorithm is used to sort the solution set. The effectiveness and rationality of the method are verified by combining the evolution case of Public Health Prevention Architecture of System-of-Systems. © 2022, Chinese Institute of Command and Control.",10.1007/978-981-19-6052-9_21,,scopus; springerlink
2020,Architectural Models Enabled Dynamic Optimization for System-of-Systems Evolution,"System of Systems (SoS) is designed to deliver value to participant stakeholders in a dynamic and uncertain environment where new systems are added and current systems are removed continuously and on their own volition. This requires effective evolution management at the SoS architectural level with adequate support of process, methods, and tools. This paper follows the principle of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and develops a holistic framework integrating MBSE conceptual representations and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to support the SoS evolution. The conceptual models provide a common architectural representation to improve communication between various decision makers while the dynamic optimization method suggests evolution planning decisions from the analytical perspective. The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) models using Systems Modeling Language (SysML) are used as MBSE artifacts to connect with ADP modeling elements through DoDAF metamodels to increase information traceability and reduce unnecessary information loss. Using a surface warfare SoS as an example, this paper demonstrates and explains the procedures of developing DoDAF models, mapping DoDAF models to ADP elements, formulating ADP formulation, and generating evolutionary decisions. The effectiveness of using ADP in supporting evolution to achieve a near-optimal solution that can maximize the SoS capability over time is illustrated by comparing ADP solution to other alternative solutions. The entire framework also sheds light on bridging the DoDAF-based conceptual models and other mathematical optimization methods. © 2020 Zhemei Fang et al.",10.1155/2020/7534819,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/7534819/,scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2020,System-of-Systems Design Optimization Based on Coevolutionary Game,"The design optimization of the system of systems (SoS) is of great significance but extremely difficult. A collaborative optimization method based on coevolutionary game is proposed to solve this problem. More specifically, it first provides a standardized design decision model for a large number of heterogeneous systems within an SoS in order to reduce the organizational complexity of the design process significantly, and then uses different game models to describe the collaborative interactions between heterogeneous systems and effectively deal with various coupling constraints and objective conflicts in the evolutionary design process of the SoS. Then, the multi-attribute utility theory, experimental design method, response surface modeling technology and differential evolution algorithm are combined to find a satisfactory global optimal solution with the least information exchange and iterative process. Finally, the design of the over-the-horizon amphibious operation equipment SoS is used as an illustrative example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",10.1109/ICECTT50890.2020.00092,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2015,Flexible and Intelligent Learning Architectures for SoS (FILA-SoS): Architectural Evolution in Systems-of-Systems,"The dynamic planning for a system-of-systems is a challenging endeavor. Department of Defense (DoD) programs constantly face challenges to incorporate new systems and upgrade existing systems over a period of time under threats, constrained budget, and uncertainty. It is therefore necessary for the DoD to be able to look at the future scenarios and critically assess the impact of technology and stakeholder changes. The DoD currently is looking for options that signify affordable acquisition selections and lessen the cycle time for early acquisition and new technology addition. This paper gives an overview of a novel methodology known as the Flexible Intelligent & Learning Architectures in System-of-Systems (FILA-SoS).

2017,An Event-Based Capture-and-Compare Approach to Support the Evolution of Systems of Systems,"Industrial software systems are often systems of systems (SoS) that evolve continuously to meet new customer requirements or to address technological changes. Despite thorough testing of the different contributing parts, the full behavior of SoS only emerges at runtime. The systems in the SoS and their interactions thus need to be continuously monitored and checked during operation to determine compliance with requirements. In particular, after changes to one system, it is necessary to check whether the overall SoS still behaves correctly and as intended. Based on an existing monitoring framework we have been developing support for capturing and comparing event traces in SoS. Our approach facilitates and partly automates the identification of differences in event traces, which often indicate undesirable behavior introduced during evolution. In this paper we motivate the need for monitoring and evolution support in SoS using an industrial example and describe our event-based capture-and-compare approach. We evaluate the applicability and scalability of our tool-supported approach, demonstrating that it can cope with comparing event traces from an industrial SoS. We present our experiences and findings intended for researchers and practitioners working on maintenance and evolution of large-scale software systems.",10.1145/3093742.3093909,,acm; scopus
2015,Interoperability as a key concept for the control and evolution of the system of systems (Sos),"A coalition of enterprises wanting to collaborate, and more generally a Collaborative Network of Organizations (CNO), can conceptually be assimilated as a System of Systems (SoS) presenting a number of characteristics to respect all over its life cycle. Interoperability is one of these characteristics (both functional and non-functional), which is from our point of view, essential in order to guarantee the control of the SoS, its behavior and the fulfillment of its mission(s). Moreover, it ensures the reaction of the SoS to deal with some risky situations and with potential local or global deficits during its functioning. In this paper, we propose to determine the relation between the current level of interoperability of the SoS and its functioning whatever may be its situation. A matrix shows how this relation evolves taking into account several characteristics of the SoS, particularly its capacity to respect interoperability requirements (Compatibility, Interoperation, Autonomy and Reversibility) and the so-called analysis perspectives of the SoS: Performance, Integrity and Stability. This relation is requested in order to permit and to guide SoS behavioral simulation currently in development. Thus, a set of indicators is derived and formalized. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",10.1007/978-3-662-47157-9_5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-47157-9_5,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar
2017,Enabling Flexibility through Forming and Evolving Systems of Systems,"Flexibility is a highly desired attribute of many systems operating in changing or uncertain conditions. This paper presents a study of enabling flexibility through designing and operating systems of systems (SoSs). The paper analyzes flexibility mechanisms of SoSs and, accordingly, identifies needs for flexibility that SoSs can meet. Following that, it proposes a hierarchical network as a more flexible SoS architecture for complex or distributed large-scale systems. Then, decision problems for forming and evolving a SoS network are defined. A case that involves integrating distributed renewable energy sources with the main grid is presented to illustrate the implementation of the proposed methodology. Results from this study support the idea of acquiring and maintaining flexibility with SoSs.

2014,An Analytic Workbench Perspective to Evolution of System of Systems Architectures,"The development of a large group of interdependently operating systems, or ‘System of Systems (SoS)’, presents significant challenges across technical, operational and programmatic dimensions. Trades between cost, schedule, performance, and associated spectrum of risks, are essential during analysis of alternatives for both individual systems and the SoS architecture as a whole. The large number of decision variables involved, ubiquitous uncertainty and complex interactions that exist between systems creates analysis problems that go well beyond the immediate mental faculties of decision-makers. Often times, the decisions made focus on localized development at the systems level with little consideration for cascading effects on the bigger SoS picture. Hence, the process of evolving SoS architectures requires tools that provides the SoS practitioner with meaningful analytical quantifications of the SoS tradespace. In the defense arena, existing tools for such trades, have been guided by policies set forth in the Defense Acquisitions Guidebook (DAG) (5000 series) and the System Engineering Guide for System of Systems (SoS-SE), but are lacking an analytic perspective towards more informed decision-making. This paper discusses a multidisciplinary effort, funded by the DoD's Systems Engineering research Center (SERC), to establish an analytic workbench of computational tools to facilitate better-informed decision-making on SoS architectures. The work is motivated by the idea that SoS practitioners possess relevant information and archetypal questions that reflect desired outcomes at the SoS level. These archetypal, technically -driven queries are mapped to relevant methods that can provide analytical outputs to directly support SoS acquisition and architectural decisions. The applicability and respective value-added of each method in addressing various archetypal measures are presented.",10.1016/j.procs.2014.03.084,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914001471,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,Dynamic Planning of System of Systems Architecture Evolution,"The dynamic planning and development of a large collection of systems or a ‘System of Systems’ (SoS) pose significant programmatic challenges due to the complex interactions that exist between its constituent systems. Decisions to add, remove, or reconstitute connections between systems can result in repercussive failures across operational and developmental dimensions of an SoS. The work conducted in this research is part of a larger body of work funded by the DoD Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) towards the development of an Analytic Workbench. This paper in particular develops a tool that adopts an operations research-based perspective to SoS level planning based on metrics of cost, performance, schedule and risk. Specifically, our work employs an Approximate Dynamic Programming approach that is well suited to address issues of computational tractability of the resulting dynamic planning optimization problem. This approach allows for identification of near-optimal multi-stage decisions in evolving SoS architectures.

2012,Developing a methodology to support the evolution of System of Systems using risk analysis,"The potential for uncontrolled evolution of member systems is one of the most significant challenges facing SoS (System of Systems) management. Lack of control in evolution makes organizations more inefficient, raises costs, and can affect their ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstance. SoS bring together individual systems to fulfill shared goals, but the systems are likely to have been developed independently, and to different development and operational standards. Member systems retain much of their autonomy, along with their motivations and goals. This increases the risk of decisions relating to evolution being taken unilaterally within member systems, potentially to the detriment of the stability, efficiency and dependability of the SoS. This paper proposes a methodology to support non specialist end users in the identification, organization and discussion of information required to manage SoS evolution, and uses a modified form of HAZOPS (Hazard and Operability Study) to analyze the associated risks of evolution. The paper evaluates the methodology using a case study based on a recent RAF (Royal Air Force) Nimrod air crash, the official investigation into which showed severe failings in the operation of the Nimrod SoS. The paper concludes that the methodology proposed would provide valuable support to SoS evolution processes, and discusses future directions for the research. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.20194,https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sys.20194,scopus; wiley; webofscience; googlescholar
2014,The evolutionary optimization of system of systems based on Agent model,"In recent years, the concept of system of systems (SoS) has emerged as a new approach to solving complex problems. Since every system evolves, the evolution has become a significant characteristic of SoS. The Agent, a self-adaptive entity, which has the perception, adaption and reaction to the changes of the environment, operates in a dynamic environment. Consequently, a method to research the evolutionary optimization of SoS based on Agent model is proposed. Since each Agent is optimized autonomously, the Agents can adopt different optimization method according to their characteristics. This is a method called “from bottom to top”, which is suitable for solving the problem of large complex systems. Finally, the conclusions are given. The evolutionary optimization of SoS based on Agent model is feasible and effective, which can be deeply researched in the future.",10.1109/ICSSE.2014.6887940,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

2017,Knowledge Based Decision Model for Architecting and Evolving Complex System-of-Systems,"Abstract Architecting complex System-of-System (SoS) has evinced keen interest recently, specifically towards factoring in the operational and managerial independence of the constituent systems, and the evolutionary and adaptive nature of SoS development. Architectural decisions have a significant bearing on the operational measures of success, referred to as Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), of the SoS. There is inherent uncertainty while making an architectural decision for complex SoS due to the incomplete knowledge on the implications of the decision. The impact on the MOEs of the SoS may be realized only later in the development lifecycle, influencing the performance and the emergent behavior of the SoS. Further, when learning cycles on the architectural decisions are experienced, once the implication of decision is realized, there needs to be means for incorporating the feedback on the decisions taken, and to reflect back on the uncertainty associated with the decisions. This paper proposes a knowledge based decision model for architecting and evolving complex SoS, that takes into account the uncertainty associated with architectural decisions and the learning cycles and feedback loops experienced. It also enables augmenting the architectural knowledge base, both at a constituent system level as well as at the System-of-System level. The proposed model adopts a decision oriented view that enables factoring in uncertainty, learning cycles and feedback loops in architectural decisions. It facilitates exploring the implications of various SoS evolution scenarios on architectural decisions, while analyzing MOEs of the SoS in relation to the MOEs of the constituent systems.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2017.00343.x,,wiley

The information is thus rendered in a form more readily usable by SoS SE practitioners in the field and one that corresponds with incremental development approaches that are the norm for SoS capability evolution. The paper describes and motivates the development of the wave model, discusses its key characteristics, and provides examples of SoS efforts that reflect this view of SoS SE. Finally, the paper describes how the information critical to successful SoS SE is created, where it fits into the wave model, how it evolves over time, and in which artifacts the information is normally contained.",10.1109/SYSCON.2011.5929039,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5929039/,ieeeexplore; scopus; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2021,MBSE delivers significant return on investment in evolutionary development of complex SoS,"The Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) is a rapidly evolving combat system of systems (SoS) product family. Managing the annual baseline updates requires processing thousands of baseline change requests, then coordinating and verifying their implementation. The complexity of this effort, which involves well over ten million source-lines-of-code (SLOC) as well as Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and military-unique hardware, is compounded by being deployed in ten variants. After a feasibility study in 2010 the SWFTS systems engineering and integration program started a transition from traditional requirements database and document-centric systems engineering (DCSE) to a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) process. At that time there was little solid evidence in the literature for a positive Return on Investment (ROI) for moving from DCSE to MBSE. Applying MBSE to this program has resulted in measurable monetary and operational benefits. We 1) summarize the DCSE to MBSE transition, 2) describe the accomplishments and observations to date, 3) define the metrics collected, and 4) quantify the achieved ROI. Background on the systems engineering and integration (SE&I) process and an apples-to-apples comparison of SE quality and efficiency are provided. The raw SE&I efficiencies of the DCSE and MBSE approaches are documented, along with conclusions showing that the MBSE approach delivers a positive ROI through higher quality SE products at significantly less cost-per-change, enables managing more baselines and SoS complexity using constant resources, and reduces the cost of the downstream integration effort. © 2021 Lockheed Martin Corporation.

2022,Strategic robustness in bi-level system-of-systems design,"Robust designs protect system utility in the presence of uncertainty in technical and operational outcomes. Systems-of-systems, which lack centralized managerial control, are vulnerable to strategic uncertainty from coordination failures between partially or completely independent system actors. This work assesses the suitability of a game-theoretic equilibrium selection criterion to measure system robustness to strategic uncertainty and investigates the effect of strategically robust designs on collaborative behavior. The work models interactions between agents in a thematic representation of a mobile computing technology transition using an evolutionary game theory framework. Strategic robustness and collaborative solutions are assessed over a range of conditions by varying agent payoffs. Models are constructed on small world, preferential attachment and random graph topologies and executed in batch simulations. Results demonstrate that systems designed to reduce the impacts of coordination failure stemming from strategic uncertainty also increase the stability of the collaborative strategy by increasing the probability of collaboration by partners; a form of robustness by environment shaping that has not been previously investigated in design literature. The work also demonstrates that strategy selection follows the risk dominance equilibrium selection criterion and that changes in robustness to coordination failure can be measured with this criterion.  © ",10.1017/dsj.2022.2,,scopus; webofscience
2021,Security and autonomic management in system of systems,"A system of systems integrates systems that function independently but are networked together for a period of time to achieve a higher goal. These systems evolve over time and have emergent properties. Therefore, even with security controls in place, it is difficult to maintain a required level of security for the system of systems as a whole because uncertainties may arise at runtime. Uncertainties can occur from internal factors, such as malfunctions of a system, or from external factors, such as malicious attacks. Self-adaptation is an approach that allows a system to adapt in the face of such uncertainties without human intervention. This work outlines the progress made towards security mitigation in system of systems using a generic autonomic management system to assist engineers in developing self-adaptive systems.

2019,Software mediators as first-class entities of systems-of-systems software architectures,"Context: In contrast to traditional software systems that are mostly created from scratch, current software systems are engineered as a junction of systems already in operation. Examples can be found in domains, such as smart cities, crisis and emergency, IoT, big data, industry 4.0, and connected health systems. Most of them can be considered systems-of-systems (SoS), since they refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, which are sometimes distributed over different environments. Therefore, SoS software architectures must be dynamic, evolve over time, and support the execution of emergent behaviors to accomplish SoS missions. They must be also designed to enable the connection of heterogeneous systems, making possible their interoperation, communication, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration, most of the times, in a seamless way. Similar challenges have been addressed by using software mediators as architectural entities. However, the application of mediators in SoS has not been properly explored. Goal: This article introduces MediArch, a layered architecture that considers mediators as first-class software entities to be used in the construction of SoS architectures. Our objective is to present evidence about how MediArch’s can support the construction of SoS architectures. Methods: The following four steps were conducted to define MediArch: (1) identification of mediation requirements to allow SoS properties; (2) establishment and categorization of twelve types of mediators, for enabling capabilities of communication and control of constituent systems interactions and conversion of heterogeneous messages exchanged through a mediation infrastructure; (3) specification of duties, behaviors, assumptions, and guarantees of mediators; and (4) organization of MediArch in three layers, namely, the constituents & consumer systems layer; the communication, conversion, & coordination layer; and the control layer. This architecture was used as the backbone for the software architectures of two SoS in different domains, namely, flood monitoring system-of-systems (FMSoS), and health-care supportive home system-of-systems (HSH-SoS), for providing evidence on how MediArch supports the architecting process of SoS. Results: MediArch (1) supports the integration of independent constituent systems, (2) provides strategies to manage emergent behaviors, (3) defines different schemes of control authorities, (4) offers elements to support SoS evolution, and (5) promotes the resilience and adaptability of SoS architectures. Conclusions: Although MediArch contributes to the establishment of SoS architectures, some challenges related to performance, resource consumption, security, safety, and non-disruptive reconfigurations must still be overcome. © 2019, The Author(s).",10.1186/s13173-019-0089-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13173-019-0089-3,scopus; springerlink; googlescholar

The dynamic and evolvable nature of SoSs poses important challenges on the validation of such systems and in particular on their regression testing, aiming at assessing that run-time changes and evolutions do not introduce regression in SoS behavior. This paper outlines issues and challenges of regression testing of SoSs, identifying the main kinds of evolution that can impact on their regression testing activity. Furthermore, it presents a conceptual framework for governing the regression testing of SoSs.

2018,Threat Analysis in Systems-of-Systems: An Emergence-Oriented Approach,"Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (SoSs) are large-scale systems made of independent and autonomous cyber-physical Constituent Systems (CSs) which may interoperate to achieve high-level goals also with the intervention of humans. Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators.

In fact, the biggest challenge in such environment lays in the preservation of the viability of the system-of-systems and its evolvement while handling component systems' dynamic integrations. This also represents a pressing issue in systems-of-systems engineering. In this paper, we present a collection of definitions dedicated to sire the system-of-systems' concept, their characteristics and typology. Next, we detail the challenges facing the integration process in systems-of-systems. Then, we present our proposition to manage this issue. It is based on an adaptive integration approach to systems-of-systems typology. Two case studies are provided in order to experiment our theory. We evaluate the performance of the approach in both cases. Results are cross-compared. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJSSE.2019.097895,,scopus

2017,Multilevel Agent-Based Modeling of System of Systems,"This paper deals with the generic modeling of systems of systems (SoSs) using agent-based modeling. SoSs are large-scale systems, including numerous-possibly heterogeneous-interacting component systems evolving in a dynamic environment. The aim of this paper is to provide generic formalism allowing to represent and control the whole complexity of a SoS using agent-based simulations. In particular, organizational aspects of SoSs are managed with the Agent-Group-Role model. Functional aspects, guiding SoSs to accomplish their global goals, are handled via a functional specification. Multilevel aspects are modeled with the Influence Reaction Model for Multilevel Simulation (IRM4MLS) agent-based meta-model. Models generated using this formalism encompass static and dynamic aspects of SoSs. They consider reorganization of SoSs caused by changes of goals or subsystem capacity. All these elements are illustrated in this paper using a SoS case study of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles initiated by the Intelligent Transportation for Dynamic Environment (InTraDE) European project to automate the port container logistic.",10.1109/JSYST.2015.2429679,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7158990/,ieeeexplore; webofscience; googlescholar
2018,Formally describing self-organizing architectures for systems-of-systems on the internet-of-things,"Nowadays, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) enables the engineering of Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems (SoS), which are opportunistically created for achieving specified missions in specific operational environments. A challenging issue in the architectural design of SoS on IoT is to conceive concepts and mechanisms for describing how an SoS architecture is able to create, on the fly, emergent behaviors from elementary IoT systems/devices. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the theory of self-organization, which makes possible that, in an SoS, its constituent systems spontaneously create and maintain a valid SoS architecture enabling the evolutionary development of the required emergent behavior to fulfill the specified SoS mission. In particular, it describes how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), based on the novel π-Calculus for SoS, was enhanced to support the architectural description of self-organizing SoSs on the IoT, upwardly causing SoS emergent behaviors at run-time. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_2,scopus; springerlink; webofscience; googlescholar
2018,Learning Framework For Maturing Architecture Design Decisions For Evolving Complex SoS,"Architecting a complex System-of-Systems (SoS) poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty and perceptions associated with understanding the implications of constituent system’s architecture design decisions at SoS level. Due to significant knowledge gaps, architects may find it difficult to uncover the ramifications of a specific decision on various Measures-of-Effectiveness (MOEs) and emergent behavior of the SoS. Subsequently, for complex SoS, learning cycles maybe experienced on the architecture design decisions. As the SoS evolves, these experiential learnings need to be factored into the uncertainty assessments of decisions and the impacted SoS MOEs, while evaluating and deciding on a specific decision. This paper proposes a knowledge based decision learning framework that factors the learning cycles experienced into the uncertainty associated with the decisions and impacted SoS MOEs. The framework takes into consideration, through an architectural knowledge base, multiple knowledge dimensions such as the attributes of the architecture design decision and the feedback loops experienced, in tandem with the complexity attributes and the knowledge gaps associated with the decision.",10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428733,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Firstly, the background and necessity on researching SoS and its robust optimization under uncertainty are introduced. Secondly, preparatory models are constructed to model the aggregations and cooperation among SoS and are regarded as the main body of further studies. Subsequently, a scenario-based model to formulate uncertainties and a Markov-based model to simulate uncertainty evolutions of SoS are introduced. Then, a novel idea for how to solving robust optimization under uncertainties in single-stage and multi-stage is proposed. The methods of the researches can be applied to solve SoS problems under uncertainty in real world, such as transportation systems planning, power grid systems operation and competition considered financial cooperation etc. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/CCSSE.2018.8724800,,scopus
2017,Emergence as Innovation in Systems of Systems - a Three Systems Model,"While emergence tends to be discussed as an outcome of a system of systems (SoS), it should be viewed as a process. Emergence is often the result of innovation within an SoS. We contend that, because of the complex adaptive nature of SoS, the assessment of the potential for innovation to create positive change is necessary for effective evolutionary planning. Innovation potential represents the convergence of three systems: the system of interest, the innovation system, and the context where these interact and come together. The three-system model is a useful perspective to assess the potential impact of innovation on the evolution of an SoS, and to describe the context of SoS emergence as enabled or constrained by its innovation system. We describe a set of methods and tools adapted from both SoS engineering and human-centered design which can be used for strategic design and planning of SoS evolution. The methods and tools are discussed with respect to the potential emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into the context of urban transportation systems, a complex adaptive SoS.",,,webofscience

2016,Synergies of System-of-Systems and Microservices Architectures,"Systems-of-Systems (SoS) are being widely embraced by both practitioners and researchers. They share properties such as distribution, evolutionary development (i.e., openness), operational and managerial independence, and emergent behavior. Those properties imply that any element (system) in an SoS is able to operate independently. Similarly, microservices are suggested as a system architecture with a strong emphasis on independence, as containers provide the required degree of isolation, and their infrastructure automation frameworks provide the means to deploy them as needed. In a microservices architecture, even data is independently managed; every service maintains its own datastore, and transaction-less interaction is emphasized. Our hypothesis in this work is that while the two approaches have been treated separately in the literature so far, they share many common characteristics, and it would be fruitful to investigate their synergies. In this paper, we analyze to what extent microservices architectures can be understood as a kind of system-of-systems, explaining some of the success of the microservices approach a consequence of their SoS properties. In addition, the best practices proposed for microservices can enable a conscious, controlled, and manageable introduction of SoS concepts into system architectures, if they are needed.",10.1145/3175731.3176176,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3175731.3176176,acm; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

It is a novel approach for research, development, test, and evaluation of unmanned systems. The Evolutionary Systems Engineering Model for Unmanned System is based on the System of Systems (SoS) Systems Engineering (SE) Wave Model [2] adopted by the DoD as best practices for Systems of Systems System Engineering [3], [5]. The SoS Wave Model was adopted by SPAWAR Systems Center (SSC) Pacific's Unmanned Systems Group to enable the agile and rapid evolution of autonomous unmanned systems. It provides the backplane for the Unmanned Systems Integration, Test, and Experimentation (UxSITE) capability at SSC Pacific. It establishes a systematic process for technology insertion and overarching strategies for managing risk and ensuring key capability objectives are met as the system evolves. Implemented as a continuous improvement process, the Evolutionary System Engineering approach provides flexibility and adaptability to address the inevitable changes in both the technical landscape and the larger operational environment. This paper provides a description of the Evolutionary Systems Engineering Model, its drivers, and how implementation of the SoS Wave Model addresses them.",10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490597,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7490597/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Risk Assessment of Infrastructure System of Systems with Precursor Analysis,"Physical infrastructure systems are commonly composed of interconnected and interdependent subsystems, which in their essence constitute system of systems (S-o-S). System owners and policy researchers need tools to foresee potential emergent forced changes and to understand their impact so that effective risk management strategies can be developed. We develop a systemic framework for precursor analysis to support the design of an effective and efficient precursor monitoring and decision support system with the ability to (i) identify and prioritize indicators of evolving risks of system failure; and (ii) evaluate uncertainties in precursor analysis to support informed and rational decision making. This integrated precursor analysis framework is comprised of three processes: precursor identification, prioritization, and evaluation. We use an example of a highway bridge S-o-S to demonstrate the theories and methodologies of the framework. Bridge maintenance processes involve many interconnected and interdependent functional subsystems and decision-making entities and bridge failure can have broad social and economic consequences. The precursor analysis framework, which constitutes an essential part of risk analysis, examines the impact of various bridge inspection and maintenance scenarios. It enables policy researchers and analysts who are seeking a risk perspective on bridge infrastructure in a policy setting to develop more risk informed policies and create guidelines to efficiently allocate limited risk management resources and mitigate severe consequences resulting from bridge failures. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis",10.1111/risa.12559,,scopus; wiley; webofscience

Because most of the master plans are developed by an authority with significant control, which might not be true in a SoS environment. Different stakeholders might have conflicting master plans that require communication, negotiation and coordination. We propose a decentralized multi-stakeholder decision making framework where local stakeholders conduct acquisition development planning for individual benefits while the SoS-level stakeholder designs a coordination mechanism to facilitate the communication between stakeholders and further achieve a harmonious outcome. Specifically, we employ approximate dynamic programming and a transfer contract coordination mechanism to address the problem. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach through a simple illustrative example.",10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.063,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002999,sciencedirect; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2016,Event Capture and Compare for Runtime Monitoring of Systems of Systems,"Today's complex software systems are highly variable systems of systems (SoS) that evolve continuously to meet new customer requirements or to address technological changes. Despite thorough testing of the different parts of an SoS, the full behavior often emerges during operation only. The systems and their interactions thus need to be continuously monitored and checked during operation to determine compliance with their requirements. In particular, after changes to one system, it is necessary to check whether the overall SoS still behaves correctly and as intended. Based on an existing monitoring framework we are developing support for capturing and comparing event traces in SoS. Our approach facilitates, and partly automates, identifying differences in event traces, which often indicate undesirable behavior introduced during evolution. In this position paper we motivate capture-and-compare support in SoS using an industrial example and present early research results including a prototype.",10.1145/2897045.2897046,,acm; ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2015,A knowledge-in-the-loop approach to integrated safety&security for cooperative system-of-systems,"A system-of-systems (SoS) is inherently open in configuration and evolutionary in lifecycle. For the next generation of cooperative cyber-physical system-of-systems, safety and security constitute two key issues of public concern that affect the deployment and acceptance. In engineering, the openness and evolutionary nature also entail radical paradigm shifts. This paper presents one novel approach to the development of qualified cyber-physical system-of-systems, with Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) as one target. The approach, referred to as knowledge-in-the-loop, aims to allow a synergy of well-managed lifecycles, formal quality assurance, and smart system features. One research goal is to enable an evolutionary development with continuous and traceable flows of system rationale from design-time to post-deployment time and back, supporting automated knowledge inference and enrichment. Another research goal is to develop a formal approach to risk-aware dynamic treatment of safety and security as a whole in the context of system-of-systems. Key base technologies include: (1) EAST-ADL for the consolidation of system-wide concerns and for the creation of an ontology for advanced run-time decisions, (2) Learning Based-Testing for run-time and post-deployment model inference, safety monitoring and testing, (3) Provable Isolation for run-time attack detection and enforcement of security in real-time operating systems.",10.1109/IntelCIS.2015.7397237,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7397237/,ieeeexplore; webofscience; googlescholar

2014,Correct by prognosis: Methodology for a contract-based refinement of evolution models,"The scope of this paper is collaborative, distributed safety critical systems which build up a larger scale system of systems (SoS). Systems in this context are independently designed and can operate autonomously following both global SoS goals and individual goals. A major aspect of SoSs is the evolution over time, i.e. the change of its architecture as a result of changes in the context of the SoS or the changes of individual or global goals. The aim of this paper is to define a modeling concept for evolution specifying all possible changes of the SoS over time. This evolution model is used to generate and analyze future architectures enabling the prediction of future violations of static specifications. We derive so called dynamicity contracts and restrict the evolution model in such a manner, that false architectures are not reached.",,,scopus
2013,On Self-Adaptation in Systems-of-Systems,"Adaptivity and systems-of-systems (SoS) have always had a close relationship, as it is one of their defining features. Moreover, there is a clear similarity between the requirements of a SoS and those of many adaptive systems, such as autonomic and self-adaptive systems. In recent years, this kind of adaptive systems has been carefully studied; however, they often operate at a very different scale, being smaller than a typical SoS. The common nexus between both perspectives seem to be situated at the architectural level: the same adaptive techniques are recursively applied in different strata in a hierarchical composite. Therefore, the principles embodied in adaptive architectures seem to provide a good basis for the definition and description of SoS. This paper relates those principles to the corresponding structures in software evolution, and suggests to coordinate both through a pace layering strategy.",10.1145/2489850.2489856,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2489850.2489856,acm; scopus; googlescholar

This paper describes strategies for value sustainment, using an application of the “wave model” to represent time-varying SoS Engineering (SoSE) activities and opportunities for SoS-change. A Maritime Security (MarSec) SoS case study is described, and simulation-based Era Analysis is used to evaluate SoS alternatives through different operational environments for an assumed 8-year time frame. Eight SoS designs are evaluated and compared across four strategies in terms of accumulated utility, discounted cost, and total down time. The four value sustainment strategies are: (1) self-recovery, the SoS is not changed (i.e., relating to survivability/robustness); (2) changes in the design of the SoS are allowed (i.e., relating to changeability); (3) changes in the architecture of the SoS are allowed (i.e., relating to evolvability) once, or (4) three times in the eight years. The results provide an example of how quantitative approaches can be used to gain insights into tradeoffs in how SoS architects can create value-sustainable SoSs for the long run.",10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549963,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6549963/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2009,Exploring the synergy between Industrial Ecology and System of Systems to understand complexity: a case study in air transportation,"Two objectives are pursued in this article. First, from a methodological perspective, we explore the relationships among the constructs of complex adaptive systems, systems of systems, and industrial ecology. Through examination of central traits of each, we find that industrial ecology and system of systems present complementary frameworks for posing systemic problems in the context of sociotechnical applications. Furthermore, we contend that complexity science (the basis for the study of complex adaptive systems) provides a natural and necessary foundation and set of tools to analyze mechanisms such as evolution, emergence, and regulation in these applications. The second objective of the article is to illustrate the use of two tools from complexity sciences to address a network transition problem in air transportation framed from the system-of-systems viewpoint and shaped by an industrial ecology perspective. A stochastic simulation consisting of network theory analysis combined with agent-based modeling to study the evolution of an air transport network is presented. Patterns in agent behavior that lead to preferred outcomes across two scenarios are observed, and the implications of these results for decision makers are described. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity for future efforts to combine the merits of both system of systems and industrial ecology in tackling the issues of complexity in such large-scale, sociotechnical problems.",10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2009.00121.x,googlescholar

2013,An Approach to Facilitate Decision Making on Architecture Evolution Strategies,"The evolution of System of Systems (SoS) architectures is a difficult process due to the complex interactions between entities that exist in an SoS. Adequate tools are thus needed in capturing these interdependencies to support informed decisions on architectural evolutions. In this paper, an approach is introduced to facilitate decision making on architecture evolution strategies. The main purpose of evolving architecture is to satisfy advanced capability and performance objectives through adding new systems, replacing existing systems, changing links, etc. The paper employs Colored Petri Nets (CPN), a powerful discrete event dynamic simulation tool, to model, simulate and evaluate the existing and evolving architectures. However, it is unrealistic to improve performance without considering the cost of architecture evolutions. This paper regards complexity as an indicator of the architecture evolving cost. Compared to other complexity metrics, dynamic complexity is included in the complexity metric in this paper. Eventually, an appropriate evolution choice could be achieved by examining the tradeoff space between complexity and performance.

2012,Why optimisation of a system of systems is both unattainable and unnecessary,"The operational and managerial independence, geographic distribution, emergent behaviour, and evolutionary development that characterise a system of systems (SoS) also ensure that it is impossible to truly optimise it. However, using the concept of satisficing, we can declare that a 'good enough' solution is in fact, sufficient. Why are we all right with this potentially unsettling notion in the context of a system of systems? In part, due to the principle of finite causality introduced in this paper, stating no system outcome can have infinitely bad (or good) implications; thus, the outcome of any action or series of actions is finite in nature. This realisation further bolsters the acceptability of an inherently sub-optimal SoS. This paper explores the notions of why optimisation of a SoS is both: 1) unattainable based on its inherent characteristics and associated systems principles; and 2) unnecessary in practice.

""Continually (but slowly) evolving"" means that the system's functionality is stable enough to be useful but is understood to be subject to modification.

2020,Characterizing Systems of Systems change and failure via network-based metrics,"A System of System (SoS) is a synthesis of independent systems functioning together towards a common goal. They are characterized by their dynamic nature and evolvability during operation: Addition, removal, and modification of component systems and functions. It is, therefore, important to characterize the tolerance of such systems to changes and failures. Most change propagation and failure analysis methods require some knowledge of failure and change probabilities, failure modes, and design parameters, which is difficult to obtain or unavailable to an SoS decision-maker, as component systems are independent in their management and operation. Consequently, this paper uses highlevel SoS functional models and network-based metrics to characterize SoSs functions and assess the functional change and failure of such systems. The proposed measures are deployed on an electric vehicle to grid-related service to show how it can aid an SoS decision-maker during the system's development and operation.

Current component integration and verification techniques are not enough in such a dynamic environment. In this paper we present ATLAS, an architectural framework that enables the runtime integration and verification of a system, based on the built-in test paradigm. ATLAS augments components with two specific interfaces to add and remove tests, and to provide adequate testability features to run these tests. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study of a dynamic reconfiguration scenario of components, in the maritime safety and security domain, using our implementation of ATLAS for the fractal component model. We demonstrate that built-in testing can be extended beyond development-time component integration testing, to support runtime reconfiguration and verification of component-based systems.",10.1109/ASEW.2008.4686292,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4686292/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2006,21 st century processes for acquiring 21 st century software-intensive systems of systems,"Our experiences in helping to define, acquire, develop, and assess 21st century software-intensive systems of systems (SISOS) have taught us that traditional 20th century acquisition and development processes do not work well on such systems. This article summarises the characteristics of such systems, and indicates the major problem areas in using traditional processes on them. We also present new processes that we and others have been developing, applying, and evolving to address 21st century SISOS. These include extensions to the risk-driven spiral model to cover broad (many systems), deep (many supplier levels), and long (many increments) acquisitions needing rapid fielding, high assurance, adaptability to high-change traffic, and complex interactions with evolving commercial off-the-shelf products, legacy systems, and external systems.",,,scopus
2015,Catalysts of Cooperation in System of Systems: The Role of Diversity and Network Structure,"Cooperation and competition are critical aspects of complex systems that intrigue researchers and practitioners alike. Recently, there has been great interest in how structure affects these cooperative behaviors and how they evolve. In this paper, we utilize the methods of evolutionary game theory on graphs to develop a model of the structured evolution of adaptive agents. Rather than simple memoryless agents, we employ adaptive agents that take on a diverse set of strategies including the cooperative catalyst tit-for-tat (TFT) and its generous and suspicious variants. We also employ all-defect, unconditional cooperation, and random strategies. Agents use these strategies during their evolution in order to maximize their own relative fitness, measured by their performance in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game versus their structural neighbors. We test the model with a variety of regular graph structures with variable degree, randomness, and size. Our parallel-execution agent-based simulations show that each strategy evolves toward its own structural niche with suspicious TFT maintaining the highest survival rate over all structures. We also show that increases in network density make the TFT strategies even more dominant, and connectivity randomness encourages cooperation in sparse networks.",10.1109/JSYST.2013.2284959,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6658829/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar
2003,Advancing systems engineering for systems-of-systems challenges,"Engineering activities in future organization development, including various information-based systems, vary, but all result in evolutions of an organization, its capabilities and systems. These evolutions occur in a context of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) where the organization must maintain a sustained, sustainable, and controlled SoS evolution as a whole. This paper presents an understanding of SoS challenges to the application of Systems Engineering (SE) in organizational evolutionary development and discusses the difference between ""developing a SoS"" and ""developing systems in a SoS context"" from an SE management perspective. A new approach to SE process organization and management is presented in order to help an organization cope with the high complexity of SoS evolutions and improve its architecture practice. Philosophically different from many SoS SE studies that consider mainly how to develop a SoS, the new approach is to add a dimension or components of SE practice at the organization level that is aimed at creating a better engineering environment to enable effective applications of traditional SE practice in implementing SoS evolutions. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.10042,,scopus; wiley; wiley
2007,Framework for understanding and shaping systems of systems - The case of industry and infrastructure development in seaport regions,"A framework has been developed that enables actors to understand and shape industry-infrastructure system-of-systems in seaport regions. The framework connects knowledge engineering with the simulation of system-of-systems evolution. It consists of a system decomposition method using ontologies, a modular agent based model and a knowledge feedback process. The framework was developed and used in a study on fostering biobased cluster evolution in the Eemsdelta, the Netherlands. To support regional development authorities who must balance the interest of each company and the system-of-systems network metrics were developed and incorporated in the simulation. Use of the framework creates a socially accepted model for systems-of-systems analysis that can directly be converted into live simulations to visualize possible directions of its evolution, which results can be used to feedback to the knowledge process.",,,webofscience

2004,4.6.2 A Knowledge Management Approach to Change Management in Systems-of-Systems,"Abstract When a complex entity comprises, for example, a set of individually complex, geographically distributed, evolving systems, the question of how to manage change to such a system-of-systems takes great significance. Not only must change be managed at the level of each component system, it must also be managed across the entire interrelated and interacting set. The solution presented in this paper is based on research that treats a class of warships in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), along with the associated operational, production and support systems, as a system-of-systems (SoS) and examines the management of change in this complex entity. The paper describes a Knowledge Management (KM) strategy that can be used to plan, manage, coordinate and implement change across the entire lifecycle of the target system-of-systems and which may be generalisable to other systems-of-systems.",10.1002/j.2334-5837.2004.tb00537.x,,wiley
2013,A lean approach to improving SE visibility in large operational systems evolution,"It is often difficult to understand the status of capability development in large operational systems. Schedules are rarely stable. This is due to factors such as: the size and complexity of capabilities; unexpected changes in priorities; depth of supplier chains; variety and availability of special engineering resources; contract structure; and the inherently complex nature of such operations. Lean approaches use the concepts of work in progress (WIP) and capacity to maximize flow through a process. Under certain circumstances, these concepts can be applied to systems engineering and development processes. This paper describes an example implementation of the concept in a large health care system of systems. To enhance both visibility and flow, the approach utilizes visualization techniques, pull-scheduling processes, and a services approach to systems engineering. © 2013 by R. Turner, J. Lane, D.

2022,Validation of Assurance Case for Dynamic Systems,"Aviation safety has accrued and applied decades of understanding on known risks and effective mitigations. That knowledge captured in compliance standards - can be tested for predictable outcomes. Autonomy that involves learning systems tend to be dynamic and may continuously be adapting to their environment. Such continuous adaptation has inherent unknown risks depending upon the guardrails imposed on the learning systems. Design assurance and use of traditional standards are inadequate for these dynamic systems.Assurance Cases are used to present an argument for the assurance of systems. Dynamic systems require that assurance cases be continuously validated. One method of validation is using real time collection of Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) which are crafted during the development of the system. This paper presents the need for SPIs and methods for creating and nurturing the SPIs to help all stakeholders. This method shadows regulations and allows risk-based approvals that may be applied for both conventional and for novel technology.Aviation is facing enormous growth in autonomous technology, reuse of components of unknown pedigree, and new aircraft designs that do not fit into Type classification. Mitigations are more heavily connected to operations, training, and other components of the ecosystem itself. The challenge is to make an assurance case for vehicles within the ecosystem. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by dynamically changing autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions to build safer systems.UL 4600, a Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products applies to fully autonomous road vehicles. The goal-based, technology-neutral features of UL 4600 have been extended to apply to aviation. So applied, the assurance process is adaptable to innovation and discovery while encouraging the current practices of standards compliance and taking a System of Systems (SoS) view. It proposes an assurance case that is an organized argument that a system is acceptable for its intended use with respect to specified concerns (such as safety, security, correctness). This paper gives guidance for validation of an assurance case through monitoring SPI within the operational context. The method by monitoring safety performance indices in the operational environment provides continued validation even as the ecosystem, components and controls change.For approval of novel systems including UAS and AAM, with features that do not lend themselves to traditional compliance methods, regulators have embraced the Safety Continuum perspective, which focuses on safety performance achieving expected outcomes. The performance-based assurance methods can be used with initially wider performance margins for certification of novel products, components of unknown pedigree, and autonomous vehicles. As the performance range is better known the margins can be decreased.Further, this paper recognizes that a one-time initial approval/acceptance is not adequate for learning systems and novel features. The continued validation through performance supports fast-paced development and product evolution. The initial assurance case for a product can limit risk through a closed environment until the margin for some unknowns is validated. for example, if the performance of collision avoidance function using new technology is not known, larger alert limits may be implemented until more confidence is gained after validating the assurance case via SPIs.The approach of monitored SPI throughout the life of the product is now feasible with the aid of big data processing. The aviation industry is already using similar methods for identifying maintenance problems. As systems grow more autonomous, more machine-to-machine exchanges are involved, making it easy to extend the monitoring and prediction practices to SPI.The method also allows for variants and derivatives of the baseline to have their own assurance case within the context of the baseline argument. The key is replacing design approval with through-life assurance that connects continuous operational safety into both the design and airworthiness determinations. The determination is predicated on the monitored SPIs and predicted performance of the product remaining consistent with the assurance argument predictions. This enables even complex automated products to be audited for airworthiness with an evolving ecosystem based on monitored and predictive data.Another advantage of the performance-based assurance case is the public comprehensibility of safety. With SPIs and predictions of performance the automobile segment has paved the way for public scrutiny of automated vehicles. The use of SPIs in aeronautical product assurance will facilitate transparency. This could be accomplished through appropriate dashboards to aid public perception and explain events and precautions taken during the evolution toward more autonomous aviation vehicles. This could reflect a stepwise evolution of complexity.This paper explores how the aviation industry can apply performance-based assurance case methods to assure new and novel as well as systems of unknown pedigree. The same framework could then be extended to autonomous systems and new types of aircraft which do not fit the current Type classification. One of the major benefits of this technology agnostic method are faster risk-based approvals of novel technology within a Safety Continuum.",10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925731,,ieeeexplore; scopus
2022,Upgrading Approach for MaaS Level 4 Using UAF,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is being commercialized and studied worldwide to overcome social issues such as transportation and environmental problems. To implement MaaS, solutions provided by different administrative, operational, and independent enterprises in different industry sectors need to be combined and integrated as a single service according to their objectives and needs. The ultimate goal of MaaS is the integration of social goals (i.e., involving regional policy; also called Level 4). To achieve this, the entirety of the systems constituting MaaS must be viewed as a System of Systems (SoS), and various stakeholders in different industry areas must work closely together based on policy objectives. In this paper, we propose an ""upgrading approach"" to enable the gradual evolution of SoS based on its architecture to achieve MaaS Level 4. The case study is called ""Snow Country MaaS,"" and it considers the heavy snowfall area of Japan. Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) is used for the architecture description. The SoS architecture of Snow Country MaaS is described by an iterative approach based on the strategic, operational, service, and resource perspectives defined in UAF. By applying the upgrading approach to the hierarchical perspectives defined in UAF, it is possible to discuss and determine policies for the evolution and criteria for the entire SoS from multiple perspectives.",10.1109/ISSE54508.2022.10005337,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience

Hence, after providing the necessary coordination, information and knowledge management based tools and techniques may be used to control the SLC of each of the individual systems in the System of Systems as well as the System of Systems itself.",10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038487,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1038487/,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience; googlescholar

In response to these threats, the DoD has an increased focus on applying proven SE techniques to SoS, which provide more functionality and performance than the sum of the constituentsystems. Tools and techniques are necessary to facilitate evolution of today's systems. One major need is the ability to develop agile SoS architectures that respond to contemporary threats.

2019,A System Dynamics and Scenarios Framework for Architecting Product Design Goals for Changeability,"The design of changeable product architecture requires modeling the dynamic interaction between products and the sociotechnical sphere, in order to understand where changeability is needed. For example, a government approval of airport expansions will impact airline operations, and the design priorities of new airliners. The purpose of this paper is to develop an approach to determine design goals for a new product architecture in system of systems (SoS). These goals become dynamic, once linked to their underlying societal changes. The characteristic of the approach is to integrate system dynamics (SD) and scenario planning; thus, SD captures quantitative aspects of societal and product function dynamics, while scenarios provide a narrative explicating parameter choices, assumptions, and implications. In this paper, SD models include business and societal aspects to evaluate long-term profitability. Goal prioritization for a new product is obtained in the form of importance weights via global sensitivity analysis; these weights are highly dependent on external functions and risk attitude, and vary in time. A toy case study deals with modeling the household freezer's past evolution in an SoS to find evolving design priorities. The result is a positive evaluation of the method, using a recent Design for Changeability framework.",10.1109/JSYST.2018.2886565,,ieeeexplore; scopus; webofscience
2019,Architecting federations of systems: A framework for capturing synergy,"This paper defines Federations of Systems, introduces a tailored architecting framework, and demonstrates it in a satellite design case study. While certainly not being new concepts in the literature, federations are a class of Systems of Systems (SoS) that have not been extensively explored due to the scarcity of applied examples and still few practitioners facing their specific design challenges. This is expected to change with the advent of the Internet of Things, Machine to Machine applications, collaborative consumption, and Federated Satellite Systems. It has become henceforth necessary to develop approaches in design and architecting capable of addressing such interconnected sets of systems. Federations are SoS characterized by the absence of global goals and stakeholders, and cooperation enabled only on an opportunistic basis. Systems engage in federations when the perceived benefit exceeds the costs of the necessary interfaces. The proposed framework quantifies the upper limits to the net benefits of cooperation between systems through the concept of synergy. Using synergy as a heuristic to navigate federated design spaces, the framework predicts the appearance and evolution of federations. The demonstration of the framework in a six-satellite federation shows that advantages of federating emerge with the collaboration between just two systems. Interface costs, architectural cost preferences, and network topology drive the achievable benefits. Specifically, when considering communication architectures under 80 MUSD for satellite systems, federating is advantageous when the interface lifecycle costs are below 15 MUSD. This demonstration case exemplifies how federating can assist systems in achieving design points that dominate the solutions of their local tradespace. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.21482,,scopus; wiley; webofscience
2018,Adaptation to extreme weather events in complex health and social care systems: The example of older people’s services in England,"Our findings contribute to a growing international literature on how conceptual models from complexity theory may be relevant to inform planning in health and social care systems, helping to adapt and improve preparedness and resilience to extreme weather events. We focus on findings from two case studies in England and their relationship to national policy for adaptation. Complexity theory helped to frame strategies for planning for events that are emergent and unpredictable. We find from our case studies that, in spite of the uncertainty involved, some ‘principles’ derived from parts of the literature on complexity theory may provide a helpful framework for the development of more robust preparedness strategies in the health and social care sector. By viewing health and social care as a ‘system of systems’, adaptation planning recognises the interrelationships of built, institutional and social infrastructures. The idea of local systems, with variable, path-dependent attributes, which are partially closed, but permeable to other parts of the wider network, leads to an actionable model of adaptation which emphasises the potential value of local self-organisation, but also underlines the importance of co-evolution across the wider system and the vital role of national initiatives and support for adaptation strategies. The value of sharing experience from local case studies across the national system, as well as among local partners, is very apparent in the experience reported here. © 2017, © European Stroke Organisation 2017.",10.1177/2399654417695101,,scopus

2016,ENGINEERING THE VIRTUAL OR COLLABORATIVE SOS,"ABSTRACT The largest, most complex, and most prevalent systems of systems (SoS) are virtual or collaborative in nature. In such a SoS, there is no central authority to perform systems engineering. Yet, the virtual or collaborative SoS does grow, adapt, and evolve in response to the needs of the many stakeholders. Changes in the SoS happen because of many changes in the constituent systems (CS), with each change occurring when the CS owners deem it useful to change. The systems engineering activities in the CS can be used to guide and affect the SoS through a collaborative and competitive environment in which each CS systems engineer seeks to optimize the SoS behavior for their own purposes. This requires a different approach to the systems engineering activities, in which greater emphasis is on the higher-level analysis, architecting, and quantification. This paper describes the modified systems engineering approach, showing how to engineer the SoS from within the scope of a CS.",10.1002/inst.12113,,wiley
2015,Simulation-based analysis of reconfigurable system of system Network topologies for resilience using Bayesian Networks,"An emerging understanding of resilient systems is as a management principle or framework allowing for reconfiguration or adaptation in the face of threats or shocks. This is a new approach engineered system resilience: the more traditional approach is that systems may focus on resistance to threats, and speedy recovery if vulnerabilities are breached. This notion can potentially integrate interdisciplinary research currently pursued in systems engineering, design theory, infrastructure risk analysis, and statistical learning to create an approach that permits both evaluation of system resilience and also the value of system evolvability in the face of operational hazards. In prior work, a vision for reconfigurable systems based on Bayesian Networks was articulated but not tested or demonstrated. In this paper, we demonstrate a Bayesian Network inspired approach to measuring the value of re-configurability in systems of systems that can be represented in directed acyclic graphs using a simulation-based approach. For the purpose of our investigation, re-configurability means that a system can adapt its structure to structural failures in either system components or links between components. The latter is called structural flexibility, whereas the former is called functional flexibility. Undirected Bayesian Networks are used to structure the relationships between the subsystem components, and the graphical model is then used in conjunction with concepts from functional dependency network theory to evaluate the response the system under updated configurations.",,,scopus

Increased level of outsourcing, significant amount of subcontractors, more integration than development, reduced project cycles, ecosystem like collaborative developments, software product lines and global development are some of the changes in the project life cycle approaches.

Enterprise capabilities evolve through the emergence and convergence of information and other technologies and their integration into social, institutional and operational organizations and processes. Enterprise capabilities evolve whether or not the enterprise has processes in place to actively manage them. Thus the critical role of enterprise system engineering (ESE) processes should be to shape, enhance and accelerate the “natural” evolution of enterprise capabilities. ESE processes do not replace or add a layer to traditional system engineering (TSE) processes used in developing individual systems or SoS. ESE processes should complement TSE processes by shaping outcome spaces and stimulating interactions among enterprise participants through marketlike mechanisms to reward those that create innovation which moves and accelerates the evolution of the enterprise.",10.1007/978-3-540-85081-6_69,,springerlink
2007,Assessing hybrid incremental processes for SISOS development,"Abstract New processes are being assessed to address modern challenges for Software-Intensive Systems of Systems (SISOS), such as coping with rapid change while simultaneously assuring high dependability. A hybrid agile and plan-driven process based on the spiral lifecycle has been outlined to address these conflicting challenges with the need to rapidly field incremental capabilities in a value-based framework. A system dynamics model has been developed to assess the incremental hybrid process and support project decision making. It estimates cost and schedule for multiple increments of a hybrid process that uses three specialized teams, and also considers the mission value of software capabilities. It considers changes due to external volatility and feedback from user-driven change requests, and dynamically reestimates and allocates resources in response to the volatility. Deferral policies and team sizes can be experimented with, and it includes trade off functions between cost and the timing of changes within and across increments, length of deferral delays, and others. We illustrate how the model can be used to determine optimal agile team size to handle changes. Both the hybrid process and simulation model are being evolved on a very large scale incremental SISOS project and other potential pilots.
